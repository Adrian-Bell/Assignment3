<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>
During the founding of Mythos. We were aware that there are currently some large competitors that offer similar features. Namely, Roll20 and World Anvil.
</p>
<p>
Although when it comes to features, we will be somewhat similar to our competitors, our partners feel confident that what defines us from the rest of the market is our focus on the user experience. Where our competitors do offer many features, they tend to be less user friendly and require a large learning curve to interact with their services.
</p>
<p>
Mythos prides itself on being a site that is a much leaner service with less features. But, as a result, our users experiences will be a lot more streamlined and user-friendly, and do not require a large amount of pre-learning to begin enjoying our services to start recording their own campaigns or fanfictions.
