  <h2>Artifacts</h2>
<p>
During the development of Mythos for this assignment, we have produced a prototype of the application and a marketing video that is intended to promote Mythos to a targeted audience on platforms such as Facebook or YouTube.  The thumbnails below link to these artifacts, and the development of the prototype application in particular forms a substantial part of this report.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>
During the founding of Mythos. We were aware that there are currently some large competitors that offer similar features. Namely, Roll20 and World Anvil.
</p>
<p>
Although when it comes to features, we will be somewhat similar to our competitors, our partners feel confident that what defines us from the rest of the market is our focus on the user experience. Where our competitors do offer many features, they tend to be less user friendly and require a large learning curve to interact with their services.
</p>
<p>
Mythos prides itself on being a site that is a much leaner service with less features. But, as a result, our users experiences will be a lot more streamlined and user-friendly, and do not require a large amount of pre-learning to begin enjoying our services to start recording their own campaigns or fanfictions.
</p>
<br class="clear">
</article>

<article>
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<br>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>
The aim of Mythos is to provide a simple yet comprehensive solution for the management of all the creative details that form the foundation of a fantasy world.
</p>
<p>
The management of these details is key to creative expression, and by subscribing to a simple yet comprehensive tool users will spend less time wading through notes and more time crafting stories and other content.  Building the framework of a world in Mythos will allow the user to craft their imagined environment within a simple and efficient tool which provides both management of intricate details and powerful visual tools to view overarching themes and plotlines.
</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
We have identified six goals we need to meet in order to work successfully towards the aim of a simple yet comprehensive content management application.  An overview of each goal is laid out under the following subheadings, with detailed information on the progress made during the assignment discussed in the Plans and Progress section.
</p>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
The complex details of the user’s creative projects will be stored in a wiki-style document storage system.  As the core features of the wiki form the foundation of the project this will be a priority for development.  Individual pages will be created for each asset, and these will be organised in a hierarchical system as described below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Assets (Pages)</li>
<li>Asset Groups (Chapters)</li>
<li>Project (Books)</li>
<li>World (Bookshelves)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The pages will be linked to allow simple and intuitive navigation through the data, with the goal being to develop an auto-link feature for the software prior to taking Mythos to market.  Initial research shows that Client And Server Scripting Implementation Subset (CASSIS) Auto_Link function provides a viable open-source option for integration into Mythos (IndieWeb, 2021), however it is likely that a semi–automated system will be used in the prototype developed for this assignment due to time constraints.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>
The management of the world’s history and significant events will be heavily reliant on the integration of a timeline feature.  This will afford the user a great overview of the events that have occurred within the story as well as the historical background that sets the scene.  It will be beneficial to the user to be able to create a number of timelines; for example for individuals or groups of characters, cities and also overarching events that affect the world as a whole.  We intend to make progress on the integration of this feature over the course of the project, with investigations again suggesting a number of open-source tools which will serve as a starting point for the development of the timeline.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Relationship Web</h4>
<p>
Keeping track of characters can be somewhat overwhelming, and whilst it is possible to record a huge amount of detail on a cast of characters in the wiki documentation Mythos requires a solution to allow an “at a glance” overview of which characters have been created and how they interconnect with each other.
</p>
<p>
A relationship web will organise the very basic information about a character and show how they are related to the rest of the population of the world.  The feature will appear as a spiders web, with users able to record all of the characters in the story and the relationship web tracing lines between them.  It will be possible to filter which characters appear in the web for clarity when viewing a wide demographic, and also to zoom in to individuals to see only their direct contacts.  This will allow writers, world builders and RPG players to see who is related to who and the nature of the relationship without interrupting the flow of the creative output of the user.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Maps</h4>
<p>
J.r.r. Tolkien stated in his 1954 letter to novelist Naomi Mitchison that “I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit (generally with meticulous care for distances). The other way about lands one in confusions and impossibilities, and in any case it is weary work to compose a map from a story — as I fear you have found” (Humphrey Carpenter, 1981)
</p>
<p>
For one of the masters of the High Fantasy genre to recommend in such strong terms the importance of maps is surely sufficient evidence that Mythos requires a high quality integrated solution for mapping.
</p>
<p>
The market ready version of Mythos will feature a fully integrated feature for composing and storing maps of the user’s world.  It will be possible to fully customise both the layout and the aesthetic appearance of the maps within the application, and modify them relative to the timeline.  This will be beneficial with regard to realignment of borders and establishment of new settlements, for example.
</p>
<p>
As with the other visual planning features included in the prototype we will include a solution to show the basic functionality of the amp builder, however full integration of a customised map builder would not be viable in the timeframe.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>User Interface</h4>
<p>
A founding principle of the Mythos project is that the application should be intuitive and easy to use, with no IT skills necessary and no steep learning curve.  Since the tool is intended to be used as a reference during the creative process it is important that it does not become a distraction.  The world’s lore is built in Mythos, but the story is written separately.  For the purposes of this project the prototype we produce will give a solid foundation for the development of the final version, however full design and integration of components such as a map editor and timeline function will require a significant investment of time and feedback from testers.
</p>

<h2>Plans And Progress</h2>
<br>
<h3>Project Origin</h3>
<p>
The original concept for Mythos came from an interest in designing an application to store the lore of a fantasy world for tabletop Role Playing Games (RPGs)  The idea was first introduced in Kieran’s Assignment 1 submission and during the early stages of forming Kaalab the group decided to further develop the plan for the remainder of the course.  This has proven to be an excellent decision, as all members have got behind the project and we have all taken great satisfaction in bringing Mythos to its current state.
</p>
<p>
During Assignment 2 we were required to build the idea for the project into a much more structured and well-defined concept.  The input of all group members has been invaluable in bringing Mythos to life, and after developing the vision we were excited to get to work on the implementation stage.
</p>
<p>
As we have worked on bringing the plans to fruition we have learned lessons, overcome a number of obstacles and changed details of the project due to others.  We have enjoyed the process and as Mythos has grown Kaalab has come together as a productive and truly collaborative team.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Project Implementation</h3>
</p>
Over the course of the previous assignments Kaalab has established a well defined proposal for the development of Mythos.  As we have worked on this assignment we have set this plan in motion to create a working prototype of the project.  Inevitably there have been a number of changes made to the original plan, however we have been able to establish a functioning instance of Mythos which accurately represents the core aspects of the project as defined over the preceding weeks.
</p>
<p>
The prototype application features a wiki for storage of creative details, along with a working demonstration of integrated map, timeline and relationship web functions.  For demonstration purposes the application has been populated with a certain amount of data.  This is intended to showcase the possibilities of the application, and users are able to continue to add data to this instance to test the functionality of the service.
</p>
<p>
The intended function of the various elements of the project have been discussed in the goals section of this report, and information on the development and implementation of significant aspects of the project is outlined under the relevant headings below.  Explanations of the implementation of the prototype should be read with consideration to the information contained in the scope section of this report.  Whilst the prototype demonstrates most of the key features of the project, we have also outlined a plan to further develop and refine the application if it were to be brought to market.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>
In the early stages of the Mythos project we identified the hosting of the wiki as an area of high importance.  Since this is such a core part of the project we recognised that our first priority should be finding a way to host an instance of BookStack and provide access to all members.
</p>
<p>
Two group members took responsibility for this aspect of the project, with each of us working on a slightly different concept to ensure we found the most effective solution.  Both methods made use of virtualisation, with significant progress made on both using a local Virtual Machine and an instance provided by Amazon Web Services.
</p>
<p>
With the local approach we were able to configure a virtual machine on one of the team’s computers using VMWare and install an instance of BookStack and all supporting components – Apache, MySQL, etc.  This launched successfully but unfortunately due to limitations on port configuration within the standard version of VMWare we reached a dead end with this approach.
</p>
<p>
Initially the plan to use AWS for hosting involved the use of a t2.micro instance running Ubuntu Server 20.04 as this was the same approach used in the local hosting solution we investigated and would allow for the most straight-forward installation.  Despite successfully installing all necessary components (Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc) it proved impossible to connect to the instance.  This was again likely due to port configuration issues, and due to time constraints it was decided to launch an instance of a pre-configured Ubuntu t3a.small VM.  This has worked well, and has allowed all team members to access the wiki for the purpose of project development.
</p>
<br class="clear">


<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>
Currently the wiki aspect of Mythos is provided by the instance of BookStack which we have hosted on our server.  The structure of the documentation has proven to be easy to use and demonstrates a fair representation of what we envisioned in the planning stage.  Before Mythos is taken to market we would like to see a template system for more consistent organisation of content.  This would mean that when a user generates a new project they already have the framework of Character, Location, Timeline and Item sections ready to populate with data.  We would also rename the hierarchical levels of the wiki to better reflect their use in Mythos.  In addition we would also seek to implen=ment an automatic linking system as discussed in the goals section of this report.  For the purposes of a proof of concept we have found the integrated semi-automated linking system to be sufficient.
</p>

<br class="clear">
<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>
For the prototype the map function is provided by Azgaars’s Fantasy Map Generator, an open source application which we have embedded into the map pages of the wiki.  This gives a demonstration of the functionality we would like to develop further for the market-ready version of Mythos.
</p>
<p>
Ideally we would seek to further develop the customisation of maps within the editor, as well as integrating it further into the Mythos user interface.  This integration would take the form of a “Create Map” option, which would then open the editor and provide options to save the user generated map as a page within the wiki.
</p>
<p>
In the development of the prototype we have encountered challenges related to the ability to save maps once they have been generated.  At present the editor provides the opportunity to customise the map and export a .png file, however in order for the map to remain editable it needs to be saved in .map format.  It is possible to save these .map files locally, and these can be reloaded in the editor.  We have, however, been unable to configure the cloud-based solution necessary for access from alternative devices.  The issue appears to be related to Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Same Origin Policy (SOP).  Essentially, since the map editor is trying to call a resource from a different domain it is blocked from doing so as a security threat.
</p>
<p>
Initial investigations of the problem have found that the map generator is able to work with resources from a Dropbox Professional account, however given the costs involved this is not a viable solution.  We also attempted to configure an AWS S3 account to allow CORS, but this did not prove to be a workable solution either.  Whilst local storage does allow the reloading of maps it is not a viable solution due to the need to use a particular workstation.
</p>
<p>
Further investigation of this issue would be a priority in the development of the map function of the full version of Mythos, however given the substantial changes in the level of integration of the map function it is likely that this would not be a major problem moving forwards.  We would intend to offer map storage as part of our subscription model when Mythos is taken to market.  This would give subscribers the option of a basic plan which allows the user to save on their device, or in their own Dropbox account.  A premium solution would allow the user to store maps on our server for a small additional fee.
</p>

<h3>Timelines</h3>

</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Relationship Web</h3>
<p>

</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>
The prototype we have produced has used BookStack as a foundation, with significant aesthetic enhancements having been made to the interface to better reflect the character of Mythos.  This has largely been done by adding CSS to a custom head section.  This has allowed us to change fonts, add background images and perform funtions such as changing the default sizes and colours of various elements across the prototype.  This solution works well for the prototype as a proof of concept, however if the project were to undergo further development significant additional alterations of the source code would be required. Custom themes is another enhancement that would be developed, since the application will appeal to wide range of creatives with very different artistic visions.
</p>
<p>
Elements such as timelines and maps have been incorporated into the project as a demonstration of the concepts we would plan to implement fully if the project were to progress further.  In the prototype these elements have been embedded into the releavant positions using an iframe element, with further integration of these tools being a priority for the release version of Mythos.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Security is an area which needs to be greatly enhanced for the project.  At present the server is not configured for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (https) traffic, which would be wholly unacceptable for any application brought to market in 2022.  Installation of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and configuration for https traffic would be a priority moving forward, and an absolute necessity prior to going to market.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately an attempt to configure this arrangement led to a crisis moment in the development of Mythos.  An elastic IP address was required to assign a custom domain name to the site for use with the SSL certificate, however once the elastic IP address was assigned the application ceased to function as intended and extensive work was required to bring the project back to the point it had been at prior to this mistake.  The root of the problem was that the site was trying to find assets located at the previous dynamic IP address, including database entries and CSS files.  We were able to access the sever and use the command line interface (CLI) to update the database to reflect the new IP address.  While this solved some of the issues the site functionality was not fully restored.  Further attempts were made to locate and update the  affected files, but due to the time-consuming and complicated nature of the work required it was decided to terminate the instance and start again with a new server.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Future Project Plans</h3>
<p>
The prototype we have produced as part of this assignment is a good representation of many of the core concepts we would intend to include in the market ready version of Mythos.  The most significant enhancement required is the full integration of the visual planning elements – the map builder, the relationship web and the timeline feature.  This will see a separate environment within the application for the creation of each type of asset, with the ability to save the asset and link to the documentation in the wiki.  This level of integration will greatly enhance to user experience, and development of the features will require considerable skills and knowledge of software programming and design.
</p>
<p>
This leads into the enhancement of the user experience as a whole.  A core goal of Mythos is to be user friendly and intuitive to use.  The management of so much content will require further development of a well-considered user interface.  We have started to develop the UI in the prototype, and this will naturally evolve as the features of the application become more integrated.  Careful consideration must be given to the future direction of this aspect of the project.
</p>
<p>
From a business perspective, we would require further market analysis and a more refined key demographic for targeting of the Mythos brand to the most appropriate audience.  This would allow the project to proceed to launch with a well defined business model and lead to the best chance of financial success.
</p>
<p>
A number of other aspects, such as security, have been discussed in the preceding sections of this report.  Overall we feel that the project is moving in the right direction and are happy with the prototype we have produced.  In sharing some of the details of the project with friends we have found a generally very positive reaction, with most people commenting that it does what it has to without being overcomplicated.
</p>

<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>
During the implementation of Mythos to date we have not formally defined roles for each group member.  We have largely taken a task-focussed approach, with each meeting having a section where progress to date is discussed and outstanding tasks have been prioritised and assigned to members.  Since we have formed a strong team with a supportive and collaborative approach this has worked well for us.  We have all learned a lot about each other’s strengths and work processes and we are able to speak openly and frankly about the project and who is best suited to particular tasks.  At this advanced stage of the project we are able to look back and retrospectively assign titles to the roles that each member has taken charge of.
</p>
<h3>Kieran Goodwill<br>Project Management</h3>
<p>
Although the original concept of Mythos was written by Kieran it has evolved and matured as it has been developed by Kaalab.  Throughout this process Kieran has consistently provided guidance and a sense of direction to the project in his role.
</p>
<h3>Adrian Bell<br>User Interface and Graphic Design</h3>
<p>
Adrian has taken on the responsibility of tailoring the aesthetics of the Mythos application, in addition to the report website and pdf document.  The structure of the wiki and embedded content have been largely designed by Adrian also, with input from other members.
</p>
<h3>Angelo Connor<br>Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>
Angelo has been responsible for designing a comprehensive plan for testing the application both through the development of the prototype we have created and further into the version that would be brought to market and beyond if Mythos were to progress to that stage.
</p>
<h3>Aidan Fox<br>Marketing and Media Engagement</h3>
<p>
Aidan has been instrumental in defining the target market of Mythos and in developing a strategy to showcase the potential of the application.  He has also undertaken a leading role in the development and video editing aspects of the presentation to be submitted as Assignment 5.
</p>
<h3>Luca Pallas and Bryan Wedding<br>Financial Planning and Business Development</h3>
<p>
Luca and Bryan have worked collaboratively on the business development side of the Mythos project.  They have researched how best to take advantage of capital investment and produced the job advertisements associated with this part of the assignment.  In addition to this Bryan has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the financial sector which he has been able to take advantage of.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Obviously the roles above do not cover many aspects of the development we have undertaken during this assignment.  As mentioned previously we have taken advantage of the strong team we have built through our extensive use of chat and twice weekly meetings to allow a somewhat fluid approach to the remainder of the project.  This has worked well and has led to a mutually supportive and trusting environment which takes full advantage of every member’s abilities.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Our focus is to develop a process of quality control that includes a series of tests that encompass every aspect of the application, from its design and structure to performance and user experience. The data and feedback provided by the testers received are used to apply bug fixes and improves, and are often iterative, with testing being applied multiple times until the game is in a polished state.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <h3>Scope of Testing</h3>
There will be many aspects of our project to be tested and they are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling and customisation options</li>
<li>Navigating and sampling all menu options</li>
<li>Intentionally failing and testing obstacles</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Testing Procedure</h3>
<p>
Our overall structure of the testing phase is summed up below:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan and design the test</li>
<li>Prepare for testing</li>
<li>Perform test</li>
<ol>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Provide feedback / Bug report</li>
<li>Test again after improvements are made</li>
<li>Repeat as necessary</li>
</ol>
<li>Report the results</li>
<li>Repair the bugs</li>
<li>Repeat step 1 and re-test</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sample Bug Report</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Summary – A brief description that identifies the issue and its impact.</li>
  <li>Background information – data about the platform and build number, along with other relevant contextual info.</li>
  <li>Steps to reproduce – instructions for developers to check the issue from their own side.</li>
  <li>Actual and expected results – a short text pointing out how the issue currently affects the player experience and how it should work without the issue.</li>
  <li>Other relevant information – any other details that can help developers/designers understand and solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Testing</h3>
<p>
  We will be implementing 5 different types of testing to ensure best practice in terms of quality control
</p>
<h5>Ad-Hoc Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing, we require the tester to so to speak, be in their own ‘environment’. Relaxed and free from checklists and be able to play the game how it is intended to play. This allows the tester to find errors that otherwise could not be found.
</p>
<p>
Through this testing, we want testers to just have a ‘feel’ of the application, without the stress of completing checklists.
</p>
<h5>Functionality Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing is to indicate whether the project is in its final phase of completion and works to the initial specifications. Generally, this phase is to ensure the basic elements are functional.
</p>
<h5>Compatibility Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing ensures that the project is optimized for all various screen sizes, but also if the final product meets the ideal requirements of the software, hardware and graphics.
</p>
<h5>Progression Testing</h5>
<p>
Once the developers fix a bug, its “fixed forever” but we do not live in this perfect world as the reality is: even if the error has been fixed or not, can easily generate more errors and those errors can generate even more errors. To combat this issue, the testers look for old errors in the current patch/code.
</p>
<h5>Security and Access Control Testing</h5>
<p>
  This type of testing identifies vulnerabilities and verifying user permissions.  For best optimization of testing our project, our targeted demographic we would like to hire/recruit would be 3-5 Testers in each category.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beginner – These testers have never played a game of DnD but are willing/exited to try and stamp their foot on the world of DnD and worldbuilding.</li>
  <li>Intermediate – These testers are Somewhat new somewhat experience, ideally have  tried other worldbuilding platforms (such as World Anvil) but find the functionality/user interface are not to their liking. </li>
  <li>Expert – These testers are the know it all’s of know it all’s, They are well equipped in knowledge and experience when it comes to worldbuilding.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Group Processes</h2>
<p>
Kaalab has grown into a well functioning team with a collaborative approach to project development. Each member of the team has their own unique skillset to draw on, and we have been able to use this to great advantage as we assign tasks to each team member.  We have been somewhat lucky in the formation of our team since our personalities have meshed well.  We have enjoyed working together and learning from each other, and have developed a very frank and open communication policy without significant conflict.
</p>

Since the formation of Kaalab we have committed to holding twice weekly meetings, which have been a great opportunity to catch up on progress and plan for the future work required for each project.  These meetings have been scheduled and held without fail and have an extremely high attendance rate considering we have members in all time zones of Australia, each with work and family commitments in addition to study requirements outside of the Mythos project.  These meetings have been held exclusively in MS Teams, and in addition to this we have made daily use of the chat function contained within the same program.  As some of the tasks have been completed as collaborative tasks between two members additional sessions have been held to complete these aspects of the project.  Although these have been more informal and undocumented they have been valuable in the collaborative nature of the work.

We have not had any problems in communication with members over the course of the projects, however if this had proved to be an issue we would have approached it as a team in a professional and considerate manner.  As evidence of this approach we have had a number of members unable to attend particular meetings due to illness or other pressing matters.  The group has been supportive of these issues in all cases and we have been able to work around the very minor hiccups one would expect with any collaborative project.  Again, open and frank discussion has been key to our success here.
