    <h2>Overview</h2>

    Mythos is a lore and world-building cloud-based app that will be a useful tool for creatives who need to create a complex story or fantasy world.
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether a creative project is based in the real world or an alternate reality, the logistical problem of keeping track of characters and events can quickly get out of hand. Historical events need to be consistent, and good storytelling requires a cast of multidimensional characters so as not to ruin an otherwise powerful story. (Molly Blaisdell, 2018)
    <br>
    <br>
    At present, there are several ways to keep track of characters, timelines and other details of the plot and there is no clear leader in the field in terms of software or even technique. Although index cards are one of the more popular options. (Michael Esser, 2018) Many writers use a corkboard, spreadsheet, or index card system, and there are several software options available such as Aeon Timeline (timeline.app) and Storyist (storyist.com), (Jim Dempsey, 2017) which will be further explored in a later section.
    <br>
    <br>
    Writing for a Role-Playing Game (RPG) has some similarities to writing for a novel, but ultimately there is a dramatic difference in that you are constructing a world and then letting the story develop organically during the game sessions. In essence, you are defining the place, the culture and historical framework and the minor characters, but the main characters will be run by the players of the game and there is a need to predict various outcomes for every scenario. (F. Wesley Schneider, 2015) In order to achieve this, it is important to have an extremely detailed and well-defined world, and Mythos will allow the writer to catalogue the details of the world in a manageable and easy to follow way.
    <br>
    <br>
    The core aspects of the world that will be managed by Mythos will be pieces of lore, characters, locations, and items. These will be defined and recorded in a wiki, which will allow for a collaborative approach to editing by users (Zach LeBar, 2017, Updated 2022). The use of a wiki will negate the need for multiple records for each element, whilst allowing them to be referenced and linked from multiple places.
    <br>
    <br>
    As an example, consider Event A, which happened at Time B, involving Characters C, D and E and items F and G in Location H. This simple event affects 8 separate records, but since they are all linked in the wiki it is a manageable task to update them and cross-reference for conflicts such as a character being in two places at once.
    <br>
    <br>
    Events will also be linked to a map and a timeline to add a visual aspect to the world that is easy to interpret at a glance. These will be intended to use as an overview of the world to facilitate the development of new plotlines which fit within the existing narrative.
    <br>
    <br>
    Further to this, a relationship web will give a visual guide to how elements interact with each other. This feature will be useful to keep track of family or cultural connections between characters (A is a brother to B so A’s sister cannot marry B’s aunt), associations between geographic points (X cannot be accessed from Y without passing through Z) and historical events (F happened, which led to G happening several years later).
    <br>
    <br>
    Whilst some of these features will be developed in the future, the core of the project is the development of a wiki to relate the People, Places, Items, Culture and History of the world to enable consistent cataloguing of vital details and ensure the integrity of the story can be managed in an easy-to-understand way.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    Mythos will provide a comprehensive and efficient solution to an ongoing problem; how do game masters, world builders and other creatives construct a complex fantasy world without losing track of details and introducing conflicting scenarios to the narrative?
    <br>
    <br>
    The project will become an invaluable tool that allows creatives to efficiently create, craft and curate their content in a comprehensive development environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are many tools available to the tabletop RPG enthusiast (James Hirtz, 2020), but most are aimed at the players rather than the game master. Those that are aimed at the game master, tend to lack the comprehensive nature of Mythos. From personal experience, it is common for game masters to have a single large document to record their world’s lore, and it is necessary to manually search for details of people and places, then bring up a separate map and images to show players. Mythos will provide a comprehensive solution to this problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    As previously discussed, there are several similarities between writing for a novel and writing for tabletop RPGs (Role Playing Game), and because of the comprehensive nature of Mythos, the tool will be able to cater to a broad spectrum of creatives. If Mythos were to move to a subscription-based model, it may even be possible to tailor the subscription packages depending on the nature of the creative work and the features required.
    <br>
    <br>
    The core aspects of the world that will be managed by Mythos will be pieces of lore, characters, locations, and items. These will be defined and recorded in a wiki, which will allow for a collaborative approach to editing by users (Zach LeBar, 2017, Updated 2022).

    <h2>Project Outline</h2>
    <h3>Content Management</h3>
    The foundation of Mythos will be the wiki-style system that organises the documents that set out the rules of the world that are being created. This will be cloud-based by default, and therefore it will be possible to read from multiple devices as required and edited or expanded upon at any time or location that is convenient. This is an important function, as it will allow content to be crafted when inspiration strikes, or at times such as during gameplay or whilst writing without becoming obtrusive. The information will, of course, update in real-time for everyone that has access to the wiki using the cloud-based function.
    <br>
    <br>
    The entries in the wiki will be editable by any user who has permission, with distinct levels of privilege being important to control who has access to the more fundamental overarching aspects of the world as opposed to less critical details. As content is added to the wiki the user will be prompted to link documents to other related entries using a tagging system. This will maintain the cohesive nature of the content and ensure the integrity of the reality being created, which is a key advantage Mythos has over alternatives.
    <br>
    <br>
    The document-based content will tie in with many other features to provide an easy to interpret overview of the world, and a way to consult the stored information in a much more user-friendly way.
    <h3>Timeline Management</h3>
    Using a story calendar is an excellent way to keep track of the unfolding events in the story (Darlene Panzera, 2020). Without a simple reference for the day-to-day details of the plot, it is easy to lose track and, for example, meet someone on Tuesday when she will not arrive until Wednesday. Mythos will incorporate this calendar function to keep track of the unfolding details of the plot as they happen.
    <br>
    <br>
    Timelines are able to depict the big picture of the world in which the story is based in a visual way. This visual language will make the complicated task of tracking a detailed background story much simpler and more intuitive. Timelines are based around up to four visual elements, and these work together to make the information easy to follow. (Connie Malamed, circa 2011)
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A way to depict the passage of time. This is the timeline itself, running left to right or top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Elements to define time periods, such as a specific colour or lines to define points in time.</li>
      <li>Elements to define specific events – Text summary and/or graphic</li>
      <li>Text labels to clarify ambiguities and explain more complex elements</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    A timeline will add a useful visual element that makes it easy to look at the history of the world and make sense of the trajectory of the story, whilst the calendar will be more useful for details of current events as they unfold. These two features will work hand in hand to keep track of the narrative.
    <h3>Location Management</h3>
    Users will have the ability to upload maps to Mythos and tag locations on them. Once tagged, a page will be created to record the details of that location. This might include information such as residents of specific towns, historical events that have happened there and other details of the plot that the creative deems relevant.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the most important tenets of creating a compelling narrative is building deep and believable relationships between characters (Masterclass Staff, 2021). As with the real world, keeping track of family groups, personal friendships, allegiances and all the other interpersonal details between characters can be complicated. In order to simplify this Mythos will incorporate a Character Relationship Web feature.
    <br>

    <h3>Character Management</h3>
    Users will have the ability to upload maps to Mythos and tag locations on them. Once tagged, a page will be created to record the details of that location. This might include information such as residents of specific towns, historical events that have happened there and other details of the plot that the creative deems relevant.
    <br>
    <br>
    Characters will be linked by lines to show who they have a relationship with and the broad nature of this relationship. This will be relatively simple to catalogue as the character pages are written but could become visually overwhelming quite quickly when the number of characters increases. To allow for this, it will be possible to filter who is included in the displayed web by filtering to family, locations, or cultural groups. This offers a huge advantage over traditional methods of tracking relationships such as rolls of butcher paper taped to the wall.
    <br>
    <br>
    The character relationship web function will allow game masters and writers to introduce characters to each other in unexpected but believable ways. Although two characters do not know each other directly, by consulting a visual representation it will be possible to arrange for them to interact through intermediaries.

    <h2>Tools & Tech</h2>

    The core aspect of the project, the wiki, will be managed by BookStack. This is a self-hosted platform for organising and storing information in a wiki-style environment. The app is free and open source, with the source being available on GitHub. Apache is typically used for hosting, and a package such as Wamp will be required for the development. Some knowledge of PHP will be required, with the hosting and scalability of the project for multiple users presenting the main challenges. For the development of the project, we may investigate hosting on a cloud-based virtual machine.
    <br>
    <br>
    Content on bookstack is broken down into three groups - Books, Chapters and Pages. These are all fully searchable at any level, with the ability to link directly to any paragraph. This will make the task of storing so much complex information as simple as possible and will greatly improve the ease of use when searching within Mythos for content.
    <br>
    <br>
    All information on the world will be stored at the book level, with separate chapters for each aspect of the world – locations, events, items, characters etc. Individual aspects of the world will be stored at the pages level to allow each aspect to be fully described within its own space yet linked to all relevant pages with which it interacts. In addition to this BookStack features cross-book sorting, page revisions and image management with the ability to lock down content with various permissions. This feature will ensure that pivotal details cannot be changed by unauthorised users and the integrity of the world can be maintained.
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to be a useful tool for creatives, there is a need for a simple user interface, and BookStack will allow for this with a WYSIWYG interface for editing pages. This will allow users to input information either manually or be prompted by a questionnaire/template to ensure a complete range of data is collected.

    <h2>Skills & Knowledge</h2>

    The first challenge in the development of Mythos will be the hosting of the app. Initially, we intend to investigate using Apache on a virtual machine supplied through Amazon Web Services or similar. The knowledge required to do this should be easy to acquire through documentation produced by cloud providers and BookStack. As an alternative to this, we might be able to host the service ourselves on a virtual machine and access it via the internet, using peer2peer connections.
    <br>
    <br>
    The back end of the wiki will be stored in a relational database such as MySQL or MariaDB, although a foundational knowledge of this should be sufficient to move forwards to the project development stage.
    <br>
    <br>
    Knowledge of PHP will also be required to write plugins to manipulate the wiki as required. This is a more complex process, although a functional working knowledge of PHP should be reasonably achievable as it is known to be a relatively straightforward scripting language with many easy to follow online tutorials available (Brenda Barron, 2022)
    <br>
    <br>
    In summary, it would be extremely ambitious to hope to gain all of the skills and knowledge required to bring the project to completion in the time available for the remainder of this course, but by focussing on key areas we hope to produce significant deliverables by conducting research into relevant areas as we work through the initial stages of implementation.

    <h2>Financials </h2>

    The structure of Mythos is designed to be a small business. This business plan has been developed to best reflect the objectives of Mythos and best support the owners of the business to abide by their tax obligations while also allowing the business to be able to adapt in the case of potential growth over the life of trading.
    <br>
    <br>
    As aforementioned, Mythos is to be a business that is small in nature which means it requires minimal human resources. Mythos aims to be run entirely online with no requirement for a physical location as any physical goods such as potential merchandise can potentially be outsourced and provided through other streams such as Amazon.
    <br>
    <br>
    This also means that the business will have low start-up costs so the requirement for funding will be handled by the partners by an equal share provided from the personal savings of the owners. Because of this, there will be no requirement to adopt funding partners or investors and there will be no requirement to take on secured debt with any financial institutions.
    <br>
    <br>
    This will allow Mythos to have easier legal obligations during start-ups. Due to the lack of financial expertise of the members and the expected low profitability of the partnership, the requirement for all income from the business to be reflected on the owner's individual tax statements to be minimal and would not inflict a large annual tax obligation on the owners.
    <br>
    <br>
    With regards to profitability for the business, Mythos plans to be a free to use wiki during the initial stages of trading and will look to grow its user base as a service to the Tabletop Roleplaying Game and Writer community.
    <br>
    <br>
    In future, once the website has developed a significant user base, Mythos partners may look to generate income via subscription-based services. As per the mentioned features of the website, the business could potentially look to offer premium features to its members at a small cost. This in turn will produce a revenue stream that will be used to pay for the general upkeep of the servers and pay for any future endeavours of the partnership.
    <br>
    <br>
    Should the plans become implemented to begin conception of Mythos, the partnership will look to contact legal services will begin the preparation of a partnership agreement and are beginning talks with accounting services to help assist in the business’s profitability projections as well as look to assist with the preparation of future tax obligations to ensure that the owners are prepared to cover any expenses required with the business's conception.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    Mythos will become a comprehensive tool for the management of creative content.  It will allow writers, game masters and other creatives to craft a complex and believable world in an efficient and dynamic manner.  The different visual tools will make the process of creating content more free-flowing due to the easy to read interface, since time spent desperately wading through disorganised notes understandably disrupts the creative flow (Amy Holland, circa 2020).  The detailed documentation stored in the wiki will form the backbone of the creative project and act as a “bible”, full of all the details of the world.
