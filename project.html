  <h2>Artifacts</h2>
<p>
During the development of Mythos for this assignment, we have produced a prototype of the application, a user documentation document and a marketing video that is intended to promote Mythos to a targeted audience on platforms such as Facebook or YouTube.  The thumbnails below link to these artifacts, and the development of the prototype application in particular forms a substantial part of this report.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>
Mythos aims to streamline and simplify the world creation process. Amateur authors and designers will be guided and supported by our world-building toolkit. We aim to improve the experience of creating a fictional story by giving the world creation tools necessary to record even large worlds with an abundance of little details.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people are moving towards traditional tabletop games that require someone to design a world ahead of time, we noticed that all of the existing world-building tools were either too specific or too complex for an amateur to grasp. Mythos, as a concept will be to make content creation a richer experience while allowing entry-level world builders to start their world projects as simple as a city with the capacity to grow into an entire planar universe.
</p>
<p>
This service is set to be an online tool that’s accessible on all platforms. It also has the ability for multiple editors to be writing entries, or for an entirely private experience, only to be shared by the client. This aspect is critical for security-conscious novelists wanting to protect their intellectual property.
</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
Tabletop gaming is a growing pastime in 2022. Mythos plans to enter into circulation as community-created content experiences another boost in popularity, tying in with trends towards tabletop games among youth demographics (Ben Singson, 2022). Those younger demographics are finding that these games are much more accessible through the digitization of the game assets (Sarah Whitten, 2021). Mythos intends to be the tool of choice for novelists and tabletop gamers alike while allowing for growth by capturing the interests of individuals interested in joining these hobbies.
</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>
During the founding of Mythos, we were aware that there are currently some large competitors that offer similar features. Namely, Roll20 and World Anvil.
</p>
<p>
Although when it comes to features, we will be somewhat similar to our competitors, our team feels confident that what defines us from the rest of the market is our focus on the user experience. Where our competitors do offer many features, they tend to be less user friendly and require a steep learning curve to interact with their services easily.
</p>
<p>
Mythos prides itself on being an efficient service that concentrates on a few key features, and as a result, our user’s experiences will be a lot more streamlined. The content management templates and applications do not require a large amount of prior knowledge to begin enjoying our services to start recording the lore of their world.
</p>
<br class="clear">

<article>
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<br>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>
Mythos aims to provide a simple yet comprehensive solution for the management of all the creative details that form the foundation of a fantasy world.
</p>
<p>
The management of these details is key to creative expression, and by subscribing to a simple yet comprehensive tool, users will spend less time wading through notes and more time crafting stories and other content.  Building the framework of a world in Mythos will allow the user to craft their imagined environment within a simple and efficient tool which provides both management of intricate details and powerful visual tools to view overarching themes and plotlines.
</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
We have identified six goals we need to meet in order to work successfully towards the aim of a simple yet comprehensive content management application.  An overview of each goal is laid out under the following subheadings, with detailed information on the progress made during the assignment discussed in the Plans and Progress section.
</p>
<h4>Wiki</h4>
<p>
The complex details of the user’s creative projects will be stored in a wiki-style document storage system.  As the core features of the wiki form the foundation of the project this will be a priority for development.  Individual pages will be created for each asset, and these will be organised in a hierarchical system as described below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Assets (Pages)</li>
<li>Asset Groups (Chapters)</li>
<li>Project (Books)</li>
<li>World (Bookshelves)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The pages will be linked to allow simple and intuitive navigation through the data, with the goal being to develop an auto-link feature for the software prior to taking Mythos to market.  Initial research shows that the Client And Server Scripting Implementation Subset (CASSIS) Auto_Link function provides a viable open-source option for integration into Mythos (IndieWeb, 2021), however, it is likely that a semi-automated system will be used in the prototype developed for this assignment due to time constraints.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>
The management of the world’s history and significant events will be heavily reliant on the integration of a timeline feature.  This will afford the user a great overview of the events that have occurred within the story as well as the historical background that sets the scene.  It will be beneficial to the user to be able to create several timelines; for example, for individuals or groups of characters, cities and also overarching events that affect the world as a whole.  We intend to make progress on the integration of this feature over the course of the project, with investigations again suggesting some open-source tools which will serve as a starting point for the development of the timeline.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Relationship Web</h4>
<p>
Keeping track of characters can be somewhat overwhelming, and whilst it is possible to record a huge amount of detail on a cast of characters in the wiki documentation Mythos requires a solution to allow an “at a glance” overview of which characters have been created and how they interconnect with each other.
</p>
<p>
A relationship web will organise the very basic information about a character and show how they are related to the rest of the population of the world.  The feature will appear like a spider’s web, with users able to record all of the characters in the story and the relationship web tracing lines between them.  It will be possible to filter which characters appear in the web for clarity when viewing a wide demographic, and also to zoom in to individuals to see only their direct contacts.  This will allow writers, world builders and RPG players to see who is related to who and the nature of the relationship without interrupting the flow of the creative output of the user.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>Maps</h4>
<p>
J.R.R. Tolkien stated in his 1954 letter to novelist Naomi Mitchison that “I wisely started with a map and made the story fit (generally with meticulous care for distances). The other way about lands one in confusions and impossibilities, and in any case, it is weary work to compose a map from a story — as I fear you have found” (Humphrey Carpenter, 1981)
</p>
<p>
For one of the masters of the High Fantasy genre to recommend in such strong terms the importance of maps is surely sufficient evidence that Mythos requires a high-quality integrated solution for mapping.
</p>
<p>
The market-ready version of Mythos will feature a fully integrated feature for composing and storing maps of the user’s world.  It will be possible to fully customise both the layout and the aesthetic appearance of the maps within the application and modify them relative to the timeline.  This will be beneficial with regard to the realignment of borders and the establishment of new settlements, for example.
</p>
<p>
As with the other visual planning features included in the prototype, we will include a solution to show the basic functionality of the map builder, however full integration of a customised map builder would not be viable in the timeframe.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h4>User Interface</h4>
<p>
A founding principle of the Mythos project is that the application should be intuitive and easy to use, with no IT skills necessary and no steep learning curve.  Since the tool is intended to be used as a reference during the creative process it is important that it does not become a distraction.  The world’s lore is built-in Mythos, but the story is written separately.  For the purposes of this project, the prototype we produce will give a solid foundation for the development of the final version, however full design, and integration of components such as a map editor and timeline function will require a significant investment of time and feedback from testers.
</p>
<h4>Subscription Model</h4>
<p>
From a business perspective, we don’t plan on running ads on the site, it would be intrusive to our design and not fit the service we are offering to our clients. We have discussed multiple tiers of subscription, ranging from free to around 10 dollars a month. The tiers scale as such:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 - Free: 250MB of storage on a public cloud, 5 total users.</li>
<li>Tier 2 – $4.99: 1GB of storage on a private cloud, unlimited users.</li>
<li>Tier 3 – $9.99: 10GB of storage on a private cloud, unlimited users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These tiers will be an excellent starting point and can be tweaked to fit the market demand. More tiers may be added in the future or alternate revenue streams explored to reduce costs and/or increase services offered.
</p>

<h2>Plans And Progress</h2>
<br>
<h3>Project Origin</h3>
<p>
The original concept for Mythos came from an interest in designing an application to store the lore of a fantasy world for tabletop Role Playing Games (RPGs). The idea was first introduced in Kieran’s Assignment 1 submission and during the early stages of forming K.A.A.L.A.B, the group decided to further develop the plan for the remainder of the course.  This has proven to be an excellent decision, as all members have got behind the project and we have all taken great satisfaction in bringing Mythos to its current state.
</p>
<p>
During Assignment 2 we were required to build the idea for the project into a much more structured and well-defined concept.  The input of all group members has been invaluable in bringing Mythos to life, and after developing the vision we were excited to get to work on the implementation stage.
</p>
<p>
As we have worked on bringing the plans to fruition, we have learned lessons, overcome several obstacles, and changed details of the project due to others.  We have enjoyed the process and as Mythos has grown K.A.A.L.A.B has come together as a productive and truly collaborative team.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Project Implementation</h3>
</p>
Over the course of the previous assignments, K.A.A.L.A.B had established a well-defined proposal for the development of Mythos.  As we have worked on this assignment, we have set this plan in motion to create a working prototype of the project.  Inevitably there have been a number of changes made to the original plan, however, we have been able to establish a functioning instance of Mythos that accurately represents the core aspects of the project as defined over the preceding weeks.
</p>
<p>
The prototype application features a wiki for storage of creative details, along with a working demonstration of integrated map, timeline, and relationship web functions.  For demonstration purposes, the application has been populated with a certain amount of data.  This is intended to showcase the possibilities of the application, and users can continue to add data to this instance to test the functionality of the service.
</p>
<p>
The intended function of the various elements of the project has been discussed in the goals section of this report, and information on the development and implementation of significant aspects of the project is outlined under the relevant headings below.  Explanations of the implementation of the prototype should be read with consideration to the information contained in the scope section of this report.  Whilst the prototype demonstrates most of the key features of the project, we have also outlined a plan to further develop and refine the application if it were to be brought to market.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>
In the early stages of the Mythos project, we identified the hosting of the wiki as an area of high importance.  Since this is such a core part of the project, we recognised that our priority should be finding a way to host an instance of BookStack and provide access to all members.
</p>
<p>
Two group members took responsibility for this aspect of the project, with each of us working on a slightly different concept to ensure we found the most effective solution.  Both methods made use of virtualisation, with significant progress made on both using a local Virtual Machine and an instance provided by Amazon Web Services.
</p>
<p>
With the local approach, we were able to configure a virtual machine on one of the team’s computers using VMWare and install an instance of BookStack and all supporting components – Apache, MySQL, etc.  This launched successfully but unfortunately due to limitations on port configuration within the standard version of VMWare we reached a dead end with this approach.
</p>
<p>
Initially the plan to use AWS for hosting involved the use of a t2.micro instance running Ubuntu Server 20.04 as this was the same approach used in the local hosting solution we investigated and would allow for the most straight-forward installation.  Despite successfully installing all necessary components (Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc) it proved impossible to connect to the instance.  This was again likely due to port configuration issues, and due to time constraints, it was decided to launch an instance of a pre-configured Ubuntu t3a.small VM.  This has worked well and has allowed all team members to access the wiki for the purpose of project development.
</p>
<br class="clear">


<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>
Currently, the wiki aspect of Mythos is provided by the instance of BookStack which we have hosted on our server.  The structure of the documentation has proven to be easy to use and demonstrates a fair representation of what we envisioned in the planning stage.  Before Mythos is taken to market, we would like to see a template system for a more consistent organisation of content.  This would mean that when a user generates a new project, they already have the framework of Character, Location, Timeline and Item sections ready to populate with data.  We would also rename the hierarchical levels of the wiki to better reflect their use in Mythos.  In addition, we would also seek to implement an automatic linking system as discussed in the goals section of this report.  For a proof of concept, we have found the integrated semi-automated linking system to be sufficient.
</p>

<br class="clear">
<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>
For the prototype, the map function is provided by Azgaars’s Fantasy Map Generator, an open-source application that we have embedded into the map pages of the wiki.  This gives a demonstration of the functionality we would like to develop further for the market-ready version of Mythos.
</p>
<img src="assets\images\mapSystem.png">
<p>
Ideally, we would seek to further develop the customisation of maps within the editor, as well as integrate it further into the Mythos user interface.  This integration would take the form of a “Create Map” option, which would then open the editor and provide options to save the user-generated map as a page within the wiki.
</p>
<p>
In the development of the prototype, we have encountered challenges related to the ability to save maps once they have been generated.  At present the editor provides the opportunity to customise the map and export a .png file, however, in order for the map to remain editable, it needs to be saved in .map format.  It is possible to save these .map files locally, and these can be reloaded in the editor.  We have, however, been unable to configure the cloud-based solution necessary for access from alternative devices.  The issue appears to be related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Same Origin Policy (SOP).  Essentially, since the map editor is trying to call a resource from a different domain it is blocked from doing so as a security threat.
</p>
<p>
Initial investigations of the problem have found that the map generator is able to work with resources from a Dropbox Professional account, however, given the costs involved this is not a viable solution.  We also attempted to configure an AWS S3 account to allow CORS, but this did not prove to be a workable solution either.  Whilst local storage does allow the reloading of maps it is not a viable solution due to the need to use a particular workstation.
</p>
<p>
Further investigation of this issue would be a priority in the development of the map function of the full version of Mythos, however, given the substantial changes in the level of integration of the map function, it is likely that this would not be a major problem moving forwards.  We would intend to offer map storage as part of our subscription model when Mythos is taken to market.  This would give subscribers the option of a basic plan which allows the user to save on their device, or in their own Dropbox account.  A premium solution would allow the user to store maps on our server for a small additional fee.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Timelines</h3>
<img src="assets\images\timeline.png">
<p>
Timelines are a major part of the Mythos concept. It’s the beating heart of creating a consistent world. The timeline feature we have used as a prototype has similar styling to that we would like to develop ourselves.  Due to time constraints we have ultimately outsourced an open-source solution from Knight Lab, Northwestern University Chicago. We believe it crucial for users to have the ability to create timelines for worlds, kingdoms, cities and significant people to keep their story consistent and believable to assist in their creative process. There would be no limit to how many timelines a user could potentially use. Our Timeline will feature the ability to display images, videos, music and link to external sources. This flexibility creates exponential avenues for our users. A timeline can link to a talking head video of their own design, embedded into the timeline to guide their own story through video.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, our timeline design is unintuitive to set up but once employed and displayed in the Wiki, is quite simple. Moving forward, we would ideally like to have a simple button click that would automate a new sheet for the timeline to be built upon and published instantly as an empty timeline display. Ideally, we would have a hidden section whereby when editing the wiki page directly, the spreadsheet will open under the timeline and be editable without navigating out of Mythos. This would be our ideal solution to keep the users’ tools all integrated and usable in one location.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Relationship Web</h3>
<img src="assets\images\relationshipWeb.png">
<p>
We decided early on that we wanted a major visual focus for a predominately word-based service. The relationship web achieves this. It is a fast and easy to comprehend way of distinguishing relationships between people, places and things in the user’s world. BookStack natively supports diagrams.net as a tool within its ecosystem. This was conveniently easy to utilise to draw out any shaped relationship web we could need. It supports labelling links and multiple branching paths. Colour coding was another key thing we required in the tool. We wanted to be able to show factions, alliances and families at a glance. No need to read everything, every time to go through the information. We predict novels and worlds with potentially a hundred or more characters. If lacking some form of grouping feature, the web overall would be an almost useless mess of lines. We briefly researched alternative specialised relationship web tools, but ultimately settled for the native solution. Attempting to incorporate a third-party application inside of our service would have possibly led to more finicky interfaces and required external resources for the diagram to be displayed.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>
The prototype we have produced has used BookStack as a foundation, with significant aesthetic enhancements having been made to the interface to better reflect the character of Mythos.  This has largely been done by adding CSS to a custom head section.  This has allowed us to change fonts, add background images and perform functions such as changing the default sizes and colours of various elements across the prototype.  This solution works well for the prototype as a proof of concept, however, if the project were to undergo further development significant additional alterations to the source code would be required. Custom themes are another enhancement that would be developed since the application will appeal to a wide range of creatives with very different artistic visions.
</p>
<p>
Elements such as timelines and maps have been incorporated into the project as a demonstration of the concepts we would plan to implement fully if the project were to progress further.  In the prototype, these elements have been embedded into the relevant positions using an iframe element, with further integration of these tools being a priority for the release version of Mythos.  Ideally, the homepage for each world a user creates would have a tab system for organising content into Maps, Timelines, Relationship Webs and Wiki Pages.  When a user selects a tab, they will see an option to create either a new page or the relevant visual tool as well as the previously generated content.  We have replicated a similar system in the prototype through the simple use of chapters, although a tab system would greatly enchance the user experience with regards to navigating content.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Security is an area that needs to be greatly enhanced for the project.  At present, the server is not configured for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) traffic, which would be wholly unacceptable for any application brought to market in 2022.  Installation of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and configuration for HTTPS traffic would be a priority moving forward, and an absolute necessity before going to market.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, an attempt to configure this arrangement led to a crisis moment in the development of Mythos.  An elastic IP address was required to assign a custom domain name to the site for use with the SSL certificate, however, once the elastic IP address was assigned the application ceased to function as intended and extensive work was required to bring the project back to the point it had been at before this mistake.  The root of the problem was that the site was trying to find assets located at the previous dynamic IP address, including database entries and CSS files.  We were able to access the server and use the command-line interface (CLI) to update the database to reflect the new IP address.  While this solved some of the issues the site functionality was not fully restored.  Further attempts were made to locate and update the affected files, but due to the time-consuming and complicated nature of the work required it was decided to terminate the instance and start again with a new server.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Market Identification</h3>
<p>
Mythos in the grand scheme is a very niche product. Our demographic is not limited to any age group or gender, but rather the more selective niche of people within the tabletop gaming, novelist and worldbuilder groups. For every tabletop game master, there are four to five players. For every novelist, only a handful would require a content management system for the depth of characters and lore. Worldbuilders for the most part are cartographers and do a lot of their work as a hobby. With all this in mind, we still expect a good portion of people to be at least curious about the product and trial its features. From this, we can extrapolate out numbers and poll our users for features to be implemented or changes to the system to better field our product. We plan for our service to be as broad as possible to encapsulate all features that might be required by these individuals.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Business Planning</h3>
<p>
Primarily, Mythos is a cloud service. It has low overheads and a relatively low cost to create. The real costs begin when the introduction of in house development and services are introduced. These services would come at a premium and as such our business model would be in the form of a subscription service. We would offer tiers of support, starting at a free tier with a small amount of storage, and then increasing the storage and user accounts as the monetary values increased. This would be a very flexible option and would be heavily researched at the time of execution. Ideally, we would attempt to grow the userbase for the service for as long as possible without incurring to much overhead costs. Only when it becomes untenable would the subscription be employed to ensure the longevity of the product. New features that are developed in-house may require a cost to utilise, but this would be decided on a case by case basis and only if the feature has a perceivable change in Mythos’s user experience.</p>
<br class="clear">
<h3>Future Project Plans</h3>
<p>
The prototype we have produced as part of this assignment is a good representation of many of the core concepts, we would intend to include in the market-ready version of Mythos.  The most significant enhancement required is the full integration of the visual planning elements – the map builder, the relationship web, and the timeline feature.  This will see a separate environment within the application for the creation of each type of asset, with the ability to save the asset and link to the documentation in the wiki.  This level of integration will greatly enhance to user experience, and the development of the features will require considerable skills and knowledge of software programming and design.
</p>
<p>
This leads to the enhancement of the user experience as a whole.  A core goal of Mythos is to be user friendly and intuitive to use.  The management of so much content will require further development of a well-considered user interface.  We have started to develop the UI in the prototype, and this will naturally evolve as the features of the application become more integrated.  Careful consideration must be given to the future direction of this aspect of the project.
</p>
<p>
From a business perspective, we would require further market analysis and a more refined key demographic for targeting of the Mythos brand to the most appropriate audience.  This would allow the project to proceed to launch with a well-defined business model and lead to the best chance of financial success.
</p>
<p>
A number of other aspects, such as security, have been discussed in the preceding sections of this report.  Overall, we feel that the project is moving in the right direction and are happy with the prototype we have produced.  In sharing some of the details of the project with friends we have found a generally very positive reaction, with most people commenting that it does what it has to without being overcomplicated.
</p>

<article>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>
During the implementation of Mythos to date, we have not formally defined roles for each group member.  We have largely taken a task-focussed approach, with each meeting having a section where progress to date is discussed and outstanding tasks have been prioritised and assigned to members.  Since we have formed a strong team with a supportive and collaborative approach this has worked well for us.  We have all learned a lot about each other’s strengths and work processes and we can speak openly and frankly about the project and who is best suited to particular tasks.  At this advanced stage of the project, we are able to look back and retrospectively assign titles to the roles that each member has taken charge of.
</p>
<h3>Kieran Goodwill<br>Project Management</h3>
<p>
Although the original concept of Mythos was written by Kieran it has evolved and matured as it has been developed by K.A.A.L.A.B.  Throughout this process Kieran has consistently provided guidance and a sense of direction to the project in his role.
</p>
<h3>Adrian Bell<br>User Interface and Graphic Design</h3>
<p>
Adrian has taken on the responsibility of tailoring the aesthetics of the Mythos application, in addition to the report website and pdf document.  The structure of the wiki and embedded content have been largely designed by Adrian also, with input from other members.
</p>
<h3>Angelo Connor<br>Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>
Angelo has been responsible for designing a comprehensive plan for testing the application both through the development of the prototype we have created and further into the version that would be brought to market and beyond if Mythos were to progress to that stage.
</p>
<h3>Aidan Fox<br>Marketing and Media Engagement</h3>
<p>
Aidan has been instrumental in defining the target market of Mythos and in developing a strategy to showcase the potential of the application.  He has also undertaken a leading role in the development and video editing aspects of the presentation to be submitted as Assignment 5.
</p>
<h3>Luca Pallas and Bryan Wedding<br>Financial Planning and Business Development</h3>
<p>
Luca and Bryan have worked collaboratively on the business development side of the Mythos project.  They have researched how best to take advantage of capital investment and produced the job advertisements associated with this part of the assignment.  In addition to this Bryan has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the financial sector which he has been able to take advantage of.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Obviously, the roles above do not cover many aspects of the development we have undertaken during this assignment.  As mentioned previously we have taken advantage of the strong team we have built through our extensive use of chat and twice-weekly meetings to allow a somewhat fluid approach to the remainder of the project.  This has worked well and has led to a mutually supportive and trusting environment that takes full advantage of every member’s ability.
</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
<p>
Over the course of the assignment period, K.A.A.L.A.B hopes to develop a working prototype of Mythos which contains a functioning representation of all major aspects of the application, as listed below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wiki Documentation System </li>
  <li>Map Editor</li>
  <li>Timeline Feature</li>
  <li>Relationship Web</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The prototype will allow us to show a representation of these key features but will not seek to fully integrate them into the application to the same depth that we envision for the market-ready version of the software.
</p>
<p>
  We intend to host the prototype in a way that allows reliable access, and we hope to offer users access to this prototype to demonstrate the basic functionality of the project.  We will allow the ability to register an account, log in, view, create and edit projects within Mythos.
</p>
<p>
  Our intention is not to create a market-ready version of Mythos, but simply to show a proof of concept and demonstration of the core features.  We do not intend to develop complex features such as a fully functional map editor but will rather rely on the integration of open-source software which gives a good representation of what we would hope to achieve given further time and resources.

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>
During the development of the artifacts, we have used the tools listed below.  These are representative of the requirements of Mythos moving forward, although obviously, projects such as this will change somewhat during development so the list should not be considered exhaustive.  Prior to undertaking this assignment none of the members of K.A.A.L.A.B. have had experience in the use of most of the tools listed.  The main exceptions to this are the tools contained as part of the Adobe Creative Suite.  Most team members have had limited exposure to these tools in the past, and K.A.A.L.A.B. has used Adobe Premier Pro and Adobe Illustrator in the development of some of the graphics used in the project as well as the marketing video artifact.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<br>
<p>
Our focus is to develop a process of quality control that includes a series of tests that encompass every aspect of the application, from its design and structure to performance and user experience. The data and feedback provided by the testers received are used to apply bug fixes and improvements, and are often iterative, with testing being applied multiple times until the game is in a polished state.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <h3>Scope of Testing</h3>
There will be many aspects of our project to be tested and they are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling and customisation options</li>
<li>Navigating and sampling all menu options</li>
<li>Intentionally failing and testing obstacles</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Testing Procedure</h3>
<p>
Our overall structure of the testing phase is summed up below:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan and design the test</li>
<li>Prepare for testing</li>
<li>Perform test</li>
<ol>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Provide feedback / Bug report</li>
<li>Test again after improvements are made</li>
<li>Repeat as necessary</li>
</ol>
<li>Report the results</li>
<li>Repair the bugs</li>
<li>Repeat step 1 and re-test</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The test environment involves setting up of distinct areas like :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setup of Test Server – Every test may not be executed on a local machine. It may need establishing a test server, which can support applications.</li>
  <li>Network – We need to set up the network as per requirements.</li>
  <li>Test PC Setup – We need to set up different browsers for different testers. </li>
  <li>Bug Reporting – Bug reporting tools should be provided to testers.</li>
  <li>Creating Test Data for the Test Environment – Many companies use a separate test environment to test the software product. The common approach used is to copy production data to test.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Sample Bug Report</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Summary – A brief description that identifies the issue and its impact.</li>
  <li>Background information – data about the platform and build number, along with other relevant contextual info.</li>
  <li>Steps to reproduce – instructions for developers to check the issue from their own side.</li>
  <li>Actual and expected results – a short text pointing out how the issue currently affects the player experience and how it should work without the issue.</li>
  <li>Other relevant information – any other details that can help developers/designers understand and solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Testing</h3>
<p>
  We will be implementing 5 different types of testing to ensure best practice in terms of quality control
</p>
<h5>Ad-Hoc Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing, we require the tester to so to speak, be in their own ‘environment’. Relaxed and free from checklists and be able to play the game how it is intended to play. This allows the tester to find errors that otherwise could not be found.
</p>
<p>
Through this testing, we want testers to just have a ‘feel’ of the application, without the stress of completing checklists.
</p>
<h5>Functionality Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing is to indicate whether the project is in its final phase of completion and works to the initial specifications. Generally, this phase is to ensure the basic elements are functional.
</p>
<h5>Compatibility Testing</h5>
<p>
This type of testing ensures that the project is optimized for all various screen sizes, but also if the final product meets the ideal requirements of the software, hardware and graphics.
</p>
<h5>Progression Testing</h5>
<p>
Once the developers fix a bug, its “fixed forever” but we do not live in this perfect world as the reality is: even if the error has been fixed or not, can easily generate more errors and those errors can generate even more errors. To combat this issue, the testers look for old errors in the current patch/code.
</p>
<h5>Security and Access Control Testing</h5>
<p>
  This type of testing identifies vulnerabilities and verifying user permissions.  For best optimization of testing our project, our targeted demographic we would like to hire/recruit would be 3-5 Testers in each category.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beginner – These testers have never created a world for a tabletop game or novel but are willing/excited to try and stamp their foot on worldbuilding.</li>
  <li>Intermediate – These testers are somewhat new and somewhat experienced, ideally have tried other worldbuilding platforms (such as World Anvil) but find the functionality/user interface is not to their liking. </li>
  <li>Expert – These testers are highly experienced and have either a commercial or soon-to-be-commercial need for the service (existing novels, existing tabletop campaign that is recorded). They are well equipped with knowledge and experience when it comes to worldbuilding</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>
  The risks associated with Mythos fall into two broad categories.  The first of these is the potential for technical difficulties in the development of the application and scalability of the project, and the second area of risk lies with penetration of the target market and popularity of Mythos when it comes to market. Mythos has now been developed to the point of a working prototype that demonstrates the basic elements of what we would need to achieve to bring the application to market.  There is much work to be done in further developing elements of the software, particularly the full integration of the visual planning tools (Maps, Timelines, Relationship Webs).  Whilst we believe the challenge of further integrating these tools into the application would be manageable moving forward there is the potential for this task to be more difficult than anticipated.  The further development of the relationship web to reach the full potential of our vision could prove to be challenging.
</p>
<p>
  As with any product, Mythos will rely on a successful launch and positive reception to build a solid reputation among our target market.  Most of the potential users will already have some way of tracking the details of their worlds, and it is up to Mythos to prove itself as a better alternative to these methods.  We are confident that the model of providing a comprehensive selection of tools without being unnecessarily complicated will prove to be popular with users, however, without solid market research and feedback, there is always the potential to miss the mark.  It is also worth noting here that the community we intend to market ourselves to is largely tight-knit and active in discussing the tools they use.  This means that if we start strong, we will likely grow quickly, however, any misstep could lead to disproportionate levels of negative feedback.

<h2>Group Processes</h2>
<p>
K.A.A.L.A.B has grown into a well-functioning team with a collaborative approach to project development. Each member of the team has their own unique skillset to draw on, and we have been able to use this to our great advantage as we assign tasks to each team member.  We have been somewhat lucky in the formation of our team since our personalities have meshed well.  We have enjoyed working together and learning from each other and have developed a very frank and open communication policy without significant conflict.
</p>
<p>
Since the formation of K.A.A.L.A.B, we have committed to holding twice-weekly meetings, which have been a great opportunity to catch up on progress and plan for the future work required for each project.  These meetings have been scheduled and held without fail and have an extremely high attendance rate considering we have members in all time zones of Australia, each with work and family commitments, in addition, to study requirements outside of the Mythos project.  These meetings have been held exclusively in MS Teams, and in addition to this, we have made daily use of the chat function contained within the same program.  As some of the tasks have been completed as collaborative tasks between two members additional sessions have been held to complete these aspects of the project.  Although these have been more informal and undocumented, they have been valuable in the collaborative nature of the work.
</p>
<p>
We have not had any problems in communication with members over the course of the projects, however, if this had proved to be an issue, we would have approached it as a team in a professional and considerate manner.  As evidence of this approach, we have had several members unable to attend particular meetings due to illness or other pressing matters.  The group has been supportive of these issues in all cases, and we have been able to work around the very minor hiccups one would expect with any collaborative project.  Again, the open and frank discussion has been key to our success here.
