    Table 1 : “Job title vs. job market ranking” shows the job title for each group member’s ideal job, along with a ranking for employer demand according to the data supplied by Burning Glass.  From this it seems that there is much greater demand for the roles which involve working with hardware and network administration (Systems Admin, Network Engineer and Service Desk Analyst), however it is important to note this data in conjunction with the broader occupation based rankings.

  <p>
  As seen in Table 2 : “Occupation vs. job market share” software developers and engineers are by far the most sought after IT professionals according to the data supplied.  Adverts in this area account for 24% of the total market, which is more than double that of the closest rival.  This discrepancy is likely due to the wide variety of specialisations available in the software development field (for example developer, Java developer, senior Java developer, front end developer, ux designer, etc.)  As there are many transferrable skills within these jobs it is likely that developers will be able to move around within this occupation over the course of their career.  Software development positions are also projected to rise 22% over the next decade.  (Daniel Bortz, 2022)
  </p>

  <p>
  It is also worth noting that there is no Job Title information available within the supplied data for Kieran’s chosen position of Security Developer, however I have included this within the Software Developer classification.  Occupation specific data is probably more reflective of the true demand for this specialized role, as data is supplied here for “Cyber / Information Security Engineer / Analyst”

<p>
Table 4 and 5 show the group’s required IT and generic skill sets respectively, ranked according to employer demand as found in the supplied data from Burning Glass.  As expected, there is a diverse range of skills required across our various job titles, with some skills being specific to only one or two jobs, and others being required for most positions.  Overall, the IT skills are more specific to individual jobs, whereas there are more overlapping skills in the generic skills.  This is demonstrated in Figures 1 and 2.

  The three highest ranking IT skills not identified in our group’s required skill set are “Project “Management”, “SAP” and  “Business Management”.
  </p>
  <p>
  The three highest ranking generic skills not identified in our group’s required skill set are “Writing”, “Detail Oriented” and “Research”.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is worth noting that the data may be somewhat skewed, as it is derived from job adverts.  It is unlikely employers would list some of the qualities that are intrinsically part of the job, as it would be assumed that candidates would be aware of the importance of these skills.  For example, a knowledge of Git is listed as something only 2% of employers are looking for, but it would be assumed that anybody applying for a developer position would be familiar with version control.
