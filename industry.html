The information included in this section has been derived from a number of sources, as mentioned in the references.  Initially the Burning Glass data supplied as part of the assignment (above) has been interpreted with regard to the team’s ideal jobs.  Further to this, an exploration of the current state of the industry has been carried out, with particular attention being paid to the transformative changes in the industry in the years since the Burning Glass data was published.
</p>
<p>
The data paints a picture of a thriving industry which is growing in most areas, with particularly strong growth being apparent in the areas of software development.  The shift to cloud computing has seen big changes in how networks are being configured, and the growth of data centres is likely continue to lead to a rapidly changing future for network engineers.  The data centre services market is, in fact, projected to grow from $48.9 billion in 2020 to $105.6 billion in 2026.  (Mordor Intelligence, 2022)  As this transition towards cloud based infrastructure continues it is likely that network engineering positions will continue to see high levels of demand, with many opportunities arising within the tech giants that provide this infrastructure.(Kyler Middleton, 2019)
</p>
<p>
Each group member has reviewed the interpretation of the data and reflected on their choice of career path, with opinions and comments included at the conclusion of the summary.

    <p>
    Table 1 : “Job title vs. job market ranking” shows the job title for each group member’s ideal job, along with a ranking for employer demand according to the data supplied by Burning Glass.  From this it seems that there is much greater demand for the roles which involve working with hardware and network administration (Systems Admin, Network Engineer and Service Desk Analyst), however it is important to note this data in conjunction with the broader occupation based rankings, as this data paints a somewhat different picture.

            <caption><i>Table 2 : Occupation vs. job market share</i></caption>
    </table>
  <p>
  As seen in Table 2 : “Occupation vs. job market share” software developers and engineers are by far the most sought after IT professionals according to the data supplied.  Adverts in this area account for 24% of the total market, which is more than double that of the closest rival.  This discrepancy is likely due to the wide variety of specialisations available in the software development field (for example developer, Java developer, senior Java developer, front end developer, ux designer, etc.)  As there are many transferrable skills within these jobs it is likely that developers will be able to move around within this occupation over the course of their career.  Software development positions are also projected to rise 22% over the next decade.  (Daniel Bortz, 2022)
  </p>
  <p>
  It is also worth noting that there is no Job Title information available within the supplied data for Kieran’s chosen position of Security Developer, however I have included this within the Software Developer classification.  Occupation specific data is probably more reflective of the true demand for this specialized role, as data is supplied here for “Cyber / Information Security Engineer / Analyst”

Table 3 : “individual skill sets” summarises data from a number of career advice articles and job descriptions as noted in the references.  Consideration has also been given to the specific positions included in the group’s “Ideal Job” adverts.  The table ranks the top five skills in each classification for each Job Title.  The skills considered are the skills listed in the Burning Glass data, which was supplied as part of the assignment specification.

<h2>Group IT Skills</h2>

<p>
The IT skills required by the group are ranked according to employer demand in chart 1. This ranking has been determined by the Burning Glass data supplied as part of the assignment. Whilst there is obviously variation in demand, the data demonstrates that employers are looking for a diverse range of skills across our chosen positions.  As previously demonstrated in the Ideal Job section of the project, some skills are useful for a variety of job roles and some more specialized towards specific areas</p>

  <h2>Group Generic Skills</h2>
    <img class="img40" src="assets/images/industry/genericdemandchart.png" alt="Generic Skills Chart">
  <p>
Chart 2 demonstrates the employer demand for our required generic skill set. This data shows that there is extremely strong demand for good communication skills, with an even spread of demand for the remaining skills.  There is more overlap with a number of generic skills as opposed to IT skills, with Analytical Skills and Problem Solving ranked as being of importance for every position.  </p>
  <p>
It is worth noting that the data may be somewhat skewed, as it is derived from job adverts. It is unlikely employers would list some of the qualities that are intrinsically part of the job, as it would be assumed that candidates would be aware of the importance of these skills. For example, a knowledge of Git is listed as something only 2% of employers are looking for, but it would be assumed that anybody applying for a developer position would be familiar with version control.
  </p>
  <p>
  The three highest ranking IT skills not identified in our group’s required skill set are “Project “Management”, “SAP” and  “Business Management”.
  </p>
  <p>
  The three highest ranking generic skills not identified in our group’s required skill set are “Writing”, “Detail Oriented” and “Research”.

<h1>Job Opportunities & Employment Numbers</h1>
<hr>
  <img src="assets\images\industry\Job Opps.png">
  <img src="assets\images\industry\Employment numbers.png">
  <p>
    There is a high demand for Software Developers, Software Engineers and Network Engineers. This is due to mainly the world moving online, whether it be individual, an offline business, education domain to digital platforms. Especially after the global covid-19 pandemic, digital presence has been a high priority for business and individuals alike. So, tech companies need skilled software engineers/developers and network engineers to help create/build ideal software solutions, the ability to house large data/storage systems and the need for exceptional network engineers. Service Desk Analysts and Systems Administrators are a close 2nd & 3rd in job opportunities, as the need for everything to be ‘online’ companies and/or individuals are seeking these types of roles to respond to incoming requests for IT support and resolve network, hardware and software issues. Seeing as Software Developers (security specialisation) role is a more specialised field of work, there wasn’t much information to obtain, but ever-increasing demand for specific computer programs with an eye towards safeguarding computer systems and data/information will never decrease.

<h1>Projected Growth % 5 years</h1>
<hr>
  <img src="assets\images\industry\Proj Growth.png">
  <p>
    As you can see, there is a huge potential growth for software developers/engineers and network engineers. As our reliance on technology grows, from online shopping for clothes, to ording food for delivery. As such, there is a massive need for more online support, to assist with the development, implementation and maintenance of these support infrastructures. As more and more companies delve into the online market, companies are becoming more reliant on computer networks to share data, programs, files and any digital information this makes network engineers are more prominent role within an organisation using computerized system to do its work.

    <h2>Impact on Team's Ideal Jobs</h2>
      <p>
Having reviewed the data each team member has considered their choice of ideal job.  Each member's reflections on the significance of the information to their chosen career is outlined below.
      </p>
      <h3>Kieran Goodwill - Software Developer (Security)</h3>
      <img class="small" src="assets\images\kieran.jpg">
  <p>
My ideal job has definitley shifted. I still like the idea of a more support and protect approach to IT for my own career, however, given the lack of job listings and information around the role I would be happy with a more hardware focused approach.
This might take the form of a Network Security Engineer or similar moving forwards.
      </p>
      <br class="clear">
      <h3>Adrian Bell - Systems Administrator</h3>
      <img class="small" src="assets\images\adrian.jpg">
      <p>
After reviewing the data my intended career path has not changed, although as previously discussed I am only beginning my professional journey in the field and many factors could influence how I proceed in the future.  Although the nature of the work systems administrators engage in is changing, due in large part to the move to cloud-based systems, the data shows a strong and increasing demand for skilled systems administrators.  This trend is likely to continue into the future, and a career in this area seems to be a solid option.
      </p>
      <br class="clear">
      <h3>Angelo Connor - Network Engineer</h3>
      <img class="small" src="assets\images\angelo.png">
      <p>
        After reviewing the data presented, my intended career path has not changed. There will always be opportunities for the right person, in the right role and i am very passionate in the Network Engineering role.
      </p>
      <br class="clear">
      <h3>Luca Pallas - Software Developer</h3>
      <img class="small" src="assets\images\luca.png">
      <p>
My opinion of my ideal job hasn’t changed as at this point my interest still mainly lie with software development.  I still aim to learn more about hardware so an IT support desk role would also be something I would look into.
      </p>
      <br class="clear">
      <h3>Aidan Fox - Service Desk Analyst</h3>
         <img class="small" id=img src="assets\images\aidan.jpg">
      <p>
My ideal job has changed to focus more on hardware as that has more job opportunities and seems to play to my strengths better. Perhaps a systems engineering position would be more suitable for my future.
      </p>
      <br class="clear">
      <h3>Brian Wedding - Software Engineer</h3>
