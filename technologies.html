  <h2>Clouds, Services, Servers</h2>
  <p>The IT technology that has been selected is ‘Clouds, services, servers’, which can referred to under the umbrella term ‘cloud computing’. ‘The cloud’ is a remnant of IT industry slang from when technical diagrams of servers and network infrastructure for the Internet were drawn as a cloud. Moving ‘to the cloud’ became a way to refer to computing processes that were taking place on the servers-and-infrastructure part of the Internet. (Cloudflare, 2022)
  </p>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4>
  <p>The state of the art of cloud computing as stated by (Zhang, 2010) is described in terms of the key technologies and the current popular cloud computing products.

    <ul>
      <li>Architectural design of data centres: the design for a cloud computing data centre should endeavour to meet the following goals</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniform high capacity – The “maximum rate of a server-to-server traffic flow should be limited only by the available capacity on the network-interface cards of the sending and receiving servers” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Free VM (Virtual Machine) migration – “Virtualization allows the entire VM state to be transmitted across the network to migrate a VM from one physical machine to another. The communication topology should be designed so as to support rapid virtual machine migration.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Resiliency – “The network infrastructure must be fault-tolerant against various types of server failures, link outages, or server-rack failures.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Scalability – “The network infrastructure must be able to scale to a large number of servers and allow for incremental expansion.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Backward compatibility – “The network infrastructure should be backward compatible with switches and routers running Ethernet and IP.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <li>Modular data centre (MDC) is another area of fast innovation within the industry, using thousands of servers to form the network infrastructure, being interlinked by switches. These aid in rapid response times as well as helping reduce redundancy. (Zhang, 2010)
    </li>
    <li>Distributed file system over clouds such as Google File System (GFS) divide files into chunks of 64 megabytes to provide effective and dependable access to data, adjusted for running on data centres giving extremely high data throughputs with low latency and failures. (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    <li>Distributed application framework over clouds – “HTTP-based applications usually conform to some web application framework such as Java EE. In modern data centre environments, clusters of servers are also used for computation and data-intensive jobs such as financial trend analysis, or film animation.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    </ul>

    Popular and dominant cloud computing products are:
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Windows Azure platform</li>
      <li>Google App Engine</li>
    </ul>
    As this article is from 2010, some of the details may be out of date, but can assume that the points made still stand as it is referring to the key technologies that make up cloud computing, there just may be some more recent ones missing.
    </p>
    <h4>What can be done now? </h4>
    <p>There are many things that cloud computing can do at the moment. Some of these (but by no means all of them) are:
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud Storage – Services like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive allow for the storage, access, and retrieval of files via an Internet enabled user interface. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Data Backup – The cloud offers a convenient alternative to using physical mediums such as hard drives to back up data for retrieval should the original data be lost. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Big Data Analytics - By utilising cloud computing there is the ability to use big data analytics to leverage massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data to harness the benefit of obtaining business value such as evaluating customer buying habits to create targeted advertising and marketing. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - IaaS comprises of the main building blocks for cloud IT. Generally, it offers access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), operating systems and data storage space on a pay-as-you-go-basis. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
        <li>•	Platform as a service (PaaS) - PaaS refers to cloud computing services that provide an on-demand setting for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to eliminate the need for the organisation of underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and lets developers focus on the deployment and running of web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up the servers, storage, network, and databases needed. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
        <li>Software as a service (SaaS) - SaaS is a method for providing software applications over the Internet, on request and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and core infrastructure, and handle any upkeep, like software upgrades and security patching. Users can log into and use a SaaS application from any compatible device over the Internet. The actual application runs in cloud servers that may be far removed from a user's location. A SaaS application may be accessed through a browser or through an app. Online email applications such as Gmail and Office 365, are common examples of SaaS applications. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Cloudflare, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
      </ul>

      Other as-a-service cloud offerings include (but aren’t limited to):
      <ul>
        <li>Function as a Service (FaaS)/Serverless Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS)</li>
        <li>Network as a Service (NaaS)</li>
        <li>Workspace as a Service (WaaS)</li>
        <li>Database as a Service (DBaaS)</li>
        <li>Firewall as a Service (FWaaS)</li>
        <li>Identity as a Service (IDaaS)</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <h4>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4>
    <p>Some of the things that cloud computing could likely be able to do or facilitate in the near future are:
      <ul>
        <li>Quantum computing – Quantum computers use the tenets of quantum physics to execute intricate algorithm calculations and handle huge datasets in rapid time. In quantum computing, data is stored in qubits, making the process much faster, as qubits are a simpler form of data.</li>
        <li>Automation – The cloud can be used to handle tedious and time-consuming tasks which both frees up staff from performing the tasks manually and lowers the cost of operations by requiring less staff overall. (Saleem, 2020)</li>
        <li>Internet of Things (IoT) – IoT devices can utilise cloud computing as it offers high speed, performance, flexibility, and sufficient storage space to keep the data safe, find resources, and share information among different users within the same space. (Saleem, 2020)</li>
        <li>Modular Software Development – To be able to utilize the cloud technology, code and applications have to break down into smaller components which are not connected with one another. This makes it simpler for developers to upload their works into the cloud and makes accessing it from remote locations easier too.</li>
        <li>Improved performance – As the use of cloud computing and the amount of ways in which it is used increase, the speed of the networks and how efficiently data is analysed, received and delivered will also increase to meet user expectations and demands. (DataFlair , 2022)</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>Which people will be most affected and how?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4> Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
    <h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h4>
    <p>In my daily life it already has an effect as I utilise a lot of technologies that make use of cloud computing such as my email (Outlook), my storage (OneDrive), my entertainment (YouTube Music, Netflix, Disney+), and to get around (Google Maps). I also use SaaS for my schooling, such as Office 365 and will be using virtual machines in the future. There are also many apps or services that may be using the cloud, but I don’t know, such as banking, online shopping, Reddit, and then physical stores that may be using cloud technologies in their back of house or POS.
    </p>
    <h4>What will be different for you?</h4>
    <p>Well as I have kind of grown up with cloud technologies emerging and becoming more common place, I can’t really say what will be different because have already had cloud computing in many aspects of my life for a good chunk of it. Of course, if any major breakthrough such as quantum computing or True AI were to emerge as a result of cloud technologies then that would be a different question, but also one I wouldn’t be able to answer as can’t imagine what it would be like with those technologies being available.
    </p>
    <h4>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
    <p>If the trends of the use of cloud computing in finance and education continue, then my partner and son will be effected in the sense that my partner is studying Accounting online so will be utilizing cloud computing through the delivery of the course and when she starts working as an accountant will be using cloud based systems too. My son is only 4 months at the moment, so by the time he reaches school age I imagine that there will be many more ways then what already exists that cloud computing will be used in his education, such as the delivery of learning materials and the possible use of cloud-based virtual or augmented reality.
