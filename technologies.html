  <h2>Clouds, Services, Servers</h2>
  <p>The IT technology that has been selected is ‘Clouds, services, servers’, which can referred to under the umbrella term ‘cloud computing’. ‘The cloud’ is a remnant of IT industry slang from when technical diagrams of servers and network infrastructure for the Internet were drawn as a cloud. Moving ‘to the cloud’ became a way to refer to computing processes that were taking place on the servers-and-infrastructure part of the Internet. (Cloudflare, 2022)
  </p>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4>
  <p>The state of the art of cloud computing as stated by (Zhang, 2010) is described in terms of the key technologies and the current popular cloud computing products.

    <ul>
      <li>Architectural design of data centres: the design for a cloud computing data centre should endeavour to meet the following goals</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniform high capacity – The “maximum rate of a server-to-server traffic flow should be limited only by the available capacity on the network-interface cards of the sending and receiving servers” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Free VM (Virtual Machine) migration – “Virtualization allows the entire VM state to be transmitted across the network to migrate a VM from one physical machine to another. The communication topology should be designed so as to support rapid virtual machine migration.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Resiliency – “The network infrastructure must be fault-tolerant against various types of server failures, link outages, or server-rack failures.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Scalability – “The network infrastructure must be able to scale to a large number of servers and allow for incremental expansion.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Backward compatibility – “The network infrastructure should be backward compatible with switches and routers running Ethernet and IP.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <li>Modular data centre (MDC) is another area of fast innovation within the industry, using thousands of servers to form the network infrastructure, being interlinked by switches. These aid in rapid response times as well as helping reduce redundancy. (Zhang, 2010)
    </li>
    <li>Distributed file system over clouds such as Google File System (GFS) divide files into chunks of 64 megabytes to provide effective and dependable access to data, adjusted for running on data centres giving extremely high data throughputs with low latency and failures. (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    <li>Distributed application framework over clouds – “HTTP-based applications usually conform to some web application framework such as Java EE. In modern data centre environments, clusters of servers are also used for computation and data-intensive jobs such as financial trend analysis, or film animation.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    </ul>

    Popular and dominant cloud computing products are:
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Windows Azure platform</li>
      <li>Google App Engine</li>
    </ul>
    As this article is from 2010, some of the details may be out of date, but can assume that the points made still stand as it is referring to the key technologies that make up cloud computing, there just may be some more recent ones missing.
