  <h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <p>A blockchain is a distributed database where information is stored in ‘blocks’ that, once filled, get attached to previous blocks in such a way that it could be described as a chain.
When a block is attached to the chain, it is secured via cryptography or encryption thus the information cannot be altered, deleted or destroyed however it can still be viewed and added to.</p>
    <p>To participate in blockchain networks an individual would require a device capable of accessing a web browser and an internet connection, such as a mobile phone, a personal computer or tablet pc. For the aforementioned devices to be used as a node (colloquially referred to as a mining machine) it would require an internet connection and a substantial graphics card to process the encryption required. </p>
    <img src= assets/images/blockchain.jpg><p>Public blockchains allow anyone to set up their system as a network node to process additions to the blockchain and as such, the security needs to be much more intense than a private blockchain where the nodes are trusted.
An example of a public Blockchain’s security would be cryptography or an encryption along with a consensus system between nodes. With this security system, the nodes must agree on what data is the correct data. This makes malicious attacks almost impossible because it would require an attack on the majority of the blockchain’s nodes to fool the consensus system. </p>
    <p>The way to maliciously effect a blockchain need to be done by firstly corrupting the newest block and attacked up the chain.
However, the consensus system requires a 51% majority vote from all the nodes within the network that the content within the timestamps and information is correct. This makes corrupting information within a blockchain a very arduous and lengthy task that consumers copious amounts of resources to complete.
Also, in assistance to this, the expansion of blockchain networks has resulted in successfully hacking into the chain to be an insurmountable task as the number of nodes now ranges in the thousands. </p>
    <img src= assets/images/bitcoin.jpg><p>The Consensus System security feature has given users the ability to lock data in such a way that it has resulted the storage of these ledges and transactions to be so valuable that has become a currency itself. This currency is referred to as a form of cryptocurrency. </p>
    <p>Although any data point can be stored in the blocks of a blockchain, at time of authoring this report, the main use of this technology is for the creation of currency. </p>
    <p>Although, an example where Blockchain Technology has been used as something other than currency, is where it is used in the food industry to keep an unalterable ledger that tracks food from its source to the consumer destination. This verifies claims of ‘Ethically Sourced,’ ‘Organic’ and/or ‘Fair Trade.’
The implementation is also used to trace contamination through each step during the manufacturing process until the contaminant can be located. Companies such as IBM, Unilever and Walmart have already implemented this technology into their supply chains with many more developing their own solution. </p>
    <p>Also, some future theories as the potential application of blockchain technology has been to store votes for a federal election in such a way as to be pure and untampered.
Under ideal conditions, theorized by experts, this application would incorporate a public network to remove the ability for a government to own all the nodes and grant them access to manipulate the stored data.
It has been suggested that a more likely implementation would be a provided private network with the government owning the network nodes, which is far less secure but would require less participation from the voting populace to function. </p>

    <p><h3> What is the most likely impact? </h3></p>
  <p>There is a significant cost associated with people setting up public nodes. however, there are many people getting involved with “mining” bitcoin and it has resulted in an economic shortage of computer parts, particularly in graphics cards which are the main processing power behind building the cryptography in the blockchain. This is in part due to the hardware suppliers such as Nvidia not having enough logistical infrastructure in place to meet this new economic demand. </p>
  <p>A consequence of this is that many people who require graphics cards to perform within their occupations have become very irate due to the shortage of hardware and the sudden increase in demand causing a scarcity which has raised the prices significantly. </p>
  <p>Some parts manufacturers have tried to alleviate these shortages by creating “mining specific” graphics cards to allow for the main graphics cards to be in less demand. However, these parts have been halted due to a global chip shortage. </p>
  <p>A Social Consequence of these shortages is that people who depend on main graphics to complete their occupations have become very irate and resistant to the idea of block chain technology as it has caused a logistical burden on their professions. </p>
  <p>Another reason for Blockchain currencies not being adopted in professional environments is that it does not use a “Know your customer” (KYC) system and thus transactions are anonymous even though they are publicly visible. This has been exploited for illicit purposes and will continue to be used in this way as blockchain and cryptocurrency do not require a third party to utilise. An example would be deep-web websites such as silk road where a user can purchase drugs with cryptocurrency. </p>

    <p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3></p>
  <p>With blockchain becoming increasingly adapted more widely; It is becoming increasingly tempting to take advantage of using personal computers as a network node for blockchain. This allows the ability to rent out personal resources to gain passive income while these devices are not being used for their primary function. By making use of this, it is possible to obtain Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin which presently holds a higher value than the AUD (Australian Dollar). This process is made more affordable with the use of renewable energies such as solar energies as this process can be expensive. This is also important to consider as with the higher use of electricity to participate in mining it is producing a higher amount of greenhouse gasses. There are several people that are already doing this to get some extra value out of their own solar arrays. </p>
  <p>Also, with the previously theorised voting system made from blockchain technology, this would be a good system to reach out to younger voters who believe that their compulsory vote in Australia's political system to be worthless or inconsequential. With this system existing and implemented in a secure way. It would ensure voters that the system has been prevented from government tampering. As this public blockchain would be occupied and secured by thousands of politically active citizens renting their personal computers out as a node. Other benefits have been speculated but have not been significantly investigated at time of writing, as no such system has presently been implemented and no immediate plans have been made to begin development. </p>
  <p>Lastly, if blockchain were to be adopted more widely accepted currency it would further promote a cashless society where a customer would be able to use their E-Wallet to pay for a meal at a café using cryptocurrencies with just a tap of their phone or smartwatch. Ideally this would be seen to be adopted soon by multiple nations similarly to the developments seen in El Salvador who has been reported to be the first country in the world to do this as mentioned in the Article “More countries to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2022” (Shannon Williams, 2022). </p>

  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <p><h3> What Does it do? </h3></p>
  <p>“Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy” (IBM Cloud Education, 2020).  </p>
   <img src=assets/images/machine_learning.jpg><p>This is accomplished in numerous ways involving the way data is input into the AI. For Example, ‘Supervised Learning’ is where an information is input into the machine and the machine ‘guesses’ what that input represents. Then, a supervisor can mark the result produced as a success, or a failure. With this feedback the machine can learn how to guess correctly.
There are many sub-divisions of this method, such as reward-based learning, where correct responses are rewarded a higher score and the machine is told to get the highest score possible.
The other approach is unsupervised learning, where a computer is left to assume the level of relevance between data and infer correlation on its own.
Currently, unsupervised learning models are used for clustering and feature reduction. </p>
  <p>Machine learning, in its current stage, is refining and advancing the capabilities and applications of AI technologies by making them learn the same way that humans do.
The result of this is that the machine will be able to learn from its environment or provided data, then furtherly classify the information, then finally learn, and develop its actions from its successes and failures.  </p>
  <p>Machine learning is currently used in industry to sort through or extract useful data from a large data set. This is because machines have been proven to be much more capable of working through persistent workloads. </p>
  <p>This results in a significant boost in business productivity being achieved through use of this technology. Machine learning has also been proven to be able to work through large data sets such as market information for large companies that service customers globally with greater efficiency and accuracy. </p>
  <p>One particular use for machine learning is market prediction. Market prediction systems can be trained to assess relevant market data and furtherly predict, within a certain margin of error, what the market is going to do in the future, by recognising patterns in market fluctuations. This simplification of assessing the market, which is large and complex to become much more obtainable to be assessed and as a result more significant and accurate data is supplied to businesses and investors to make more informed decisions. </p>
  <p>Contrary to this, certain ethical implications have been expressed by people and has resulted in them to be reluctant to rely on an AI for economical or monetary advice.
However, there has been notable success by independent parties adopting and applying these prediction algorithms to cryptocurrency.  </p>
  <p>Another use for Machine learning, is that it has also been used for the simulation of materials. This meaning with the use of machine learning in such a way that it is possible to train an AI to simulate hair follicles or falling sand in a way that mirrors reality effectively.
This in future will be especially useful for Hollywood effects if a practical effect is too expensive or difficult to achieve without simulation.  </p>
  <p>The YouTube channel, "Two Minute Papers", is a channel that studies machine learning, provides further insight on these simulations. </p>
  <p>The Software company ‘OpenAI’ is leading experimental applications of machine learning. It has been used for experiments such as, simulating a game of ‘Hide and Seek’ between AI controlled participants or asking a computer to draft a poem which has resulted in researchers getting unpredictable but coherent responses. Studies have proven that together, machine learning and AI can be a powerful framework to develop the tools of the future. Tools which will have the potential to produce new and ground-breaking ways to carry out tasks that exceeds the limits of human capability. </p>
  <p>Neural networks are machine learning with applied neuroscience and work by creating neurons that do simple calculations and then networking them into other neurons for further processing of information, this works remarkably like a human brain and one notable result of this approach is adaptability, in that a neural network can be handed multiple sets of data and crunch through them by adapting new rules or neurons for each data set. This approach to machine learning requires a fair bit of training but once trained are far more powerful than older forms of trained algorithm </p>

  <p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3></p>
  <p>Machine learning has the power to do many things, it is expected that the animation industry will benefit from this technology as it will make rendering complex 3D (3 Dimensional) animations much more resource effective, saving on time rendering, increasing the accuracy of the render, and saving electricity in doing so.  </p>
  <p>Industry data sets will become incredibly manageable with an AI over-seeing the categorization and overall organisation of massive datasets, which will allow for much greater corporate control over their products and services. </p>
  <p>Advertising has also become much better since the advent of targeted advertising algorithms most of which are fuelled by learning AI. There are privacy concerns risen from the data aggregation required to train the advert delivery systems however it is an AI looking through the data and not humans, thus ethical concerns are dismissed as current legislation in those areas is unsure how to react to these emergent technologies. </p>
  <p>Most trades done on the stock market are done algorithmically to minimise losses and maximise profits, however the human element in trading is not lost as hybrid systems where algorithms and human discretion are used simultaneously exist and continue to be the most sustainable option for the future of the market. This may make higher education in these fields focus more on data science applications where humans and AI can coexist. </p>
  <p>Machine learning also appears to be focused on making any task for a computer more efficient, it may be predicted that super-computers may only need the raw power in our mobile phones to run complex equations and simulations, because the technology just gets increasingly efficient as time passes</p>

    <p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3></p>
  <p>Machine learning algorithms drive a lot of social media today, thus every ad that is delivered to your screen and every post you see is curated by media engines that are designed to keep you on their website. This is made possible through collection of data that is scrutinized by a trained algorithm to try and deliver the best content to you. </p>
  <p>These technologies make it trivial to set up a successful stock portfolio if you wanted to try your hand in the stock market through “algo trading” or curated stocks. This makes investments a much safer option than letting a human make an error. </p>
  <p>Additionally, the entertainment industry is hungry for uses of machine trained simulation to make better special effects and detail work. Those industries incorporating these things will make for better animations allowing more of the development to go into better writing and presentation. Even for non-animated projects, machine learning algorithms can modify existing footage to be more appealing, either by widening a smile that the actor was not feeling capable of, or by simulating life-like special effects around that actor to represent impossible effects much better, such as magic. </p>
  <p>Gamers would rejoice to hear that some of the potential applications for machine learning apply to video games. Some uses of this technology have improved rendering times for video games for super sampling resolution or raytracing. This is especially important in Virtual Reality technology as any improvements to be made rendering the game will allow the hardware to focus on tracking and keeping a stable framerate. </p>
  <p>Even if these applications do not spark any interest in this field, there is plenty to see for every set of interests, it may be more interesting to just watch as this field grows, and more applications are found and implemented into the things around us. </p>

  <h2>Clouds, Services, Servers</h2>
  <p>The IT technology that has been selected is ‘Clouds, services, servers’, which can referred to under the umbrella term ‘cloud computing’. ‘The cloud’ is a remnant of IT industry slang from when technical diagrams of servers and network infrastructure for the Internet were drawn as a cloud. Moving ‘to the cloud’ became a way to refer to computing processes that were taking place on the servers-and-infrastructure part of the Internet. (Cloudflare, 2022)
  </p>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4>
  <p>The state of the art of cloud computing as stated by (Zhang, 2010) is described in terms of the key technologies and the current popular cloud computing products.

    <ul>
      <li>Architectural design of data centres: the design for a cloud computing data centre should endeavour to meet the following goals</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniform high capacity – The “maximum rate of a server-to-server traffic flow should be limited only by the available capacity on the network-interface cards of the sending and receiving servers” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Free VM (Virtual Machine) migration – “Virtualization allows the entire VM state to be transmitted across the network to migrate a VM from one physical machine to another. The communication topology should be designed so as to support rapid virtual machine migration.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Resiliency – “The network infrastructure must be fault-tolerant against various types of server failures, link outages, or server-rack failures.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Scalability – “The network infrastructure must be able to scale to a large number of servers and allow for incremental expansion.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
        <li>Backward compatibility – “The network infrastructure should be backward compatible with switches and routers running Ethernet and IP.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Modular data centre (MDC) is another area of fast innovation within the industry, using thousands of servers to form the network infrastructure, being interlinked by switches. These aid in rapid response times as well as helping reduce redundancy. (Zhang, 2010)
    </li>
    <li>Distributed file system over clouds such as Google File System (GFS) divide files into chunks of 64 megabytes to provide effective and dependable access to data, adjusted for running on data centres giving extremely high data throughputs with low latency and failures. (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    <li>Distributed application framework over clouds – “HTTP-based applications usually conform to some web application framework such as Java EE. In modern data centre environments, clusters of servers are also used for computation and data-intensive jobs such as financial trend analysis, or film animation.” (Zhang, 2010)</li>
    </ul>

    Popular and dominant cloud computing products are:
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Windows Azure platform</li>
      <li>Google App Engine</li>
    </ul>
    As this article is from 2010, some of the details may be out of date, but can assume that the points made still stand as it is referring to the key technologies that make up cloud computing, there just may be some more recent ones missing.
    </p>
    <h4>What can be done now? </h4>
    <p>There are many things that cloud computing can do at the moment. Some of these (but by no means all of them) are:
      <ul>
        <li>Cloud Storage – Services like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive allow for the storage, access, and retrieval of files via an Internet enabled user interface. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Data Backup – The cloud offers a convenient alternative to using physical mediums such as hard drives to back up data for retrieval should the original data be lost. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Big Data Analytics - By utilising cloud computing there is the ability to use big data analytics to leverage massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data to harness the benefit of obtaining business value such as evaluating customer buying habits to create targeted advertising and marketing. (IBM Cloud Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</li>
        <li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - IaaS comprises of the main building blocks for cloud IT. Generally, it offers access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), operating systems and data storage space on a pay-as-you-go-basis. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
        <li>•	Platform as a service (PaaS) - PaaS refers to cloud computing services that provide an on-demand setting for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to eliminate the need for the organisation of underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and lets developers focus on the deployment and running of web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up the servers, storage, network, and databases needed. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
        <li>Software as a service (SaaS) - SaaS is a method for providing software applications over the Internet, on request and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and core infrastructure, and handle any upkeep, like software upgrades and security patching. Users can log into and use a SaaS application from any compatible device over the Internet. The actual application runs in cloud servers that may be far removed from a user's location. A SaaS application may be accessed through a browser or through an app. Online email applications such as Gmail and Office 365, are common examples of SaaS applications. (Amazon Web Services, 2022) (Cloudflare, 2022) (Microsoft Azure, 2022)</li>
      </ul>

      Other as-a-service cloud offerings include (but aren’t limited to):
      <ul>
        <li>Function as a Service (FaaS)/Serverless Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS)</li>
        <li>Network as a Service (NaaS)</li>
        <li>Workspace as a Service (WaaS)</li>
        <li>Database as a Service (DBaaS)</li>
        <li>Firewall as a Service (FWaaS)</li>
        <li>Identity as a Service (IDaaS)</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <h4>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</h4>
    <p>Some of the things that cloud computing could likely be able to do or facilitate in the near future are:
      <ul>
        <li>Quantum computing – Quantum computers use the tenets of quantum physics to execute intricate algorithm calculations and handle huge datasets in rapid time. In quantum computing, data is stored in qubits, making the process much faster, as qubits are a simpler form of data.</li>
        <li>Automation – The cloud can be used to handle tedious and time-consuming tasks which both frees up staff from performing the tasks manually and lowers the cost of operations by requiring less staff overall. (Saleem, 2020)</li>
        <li>Internet of Things (IoT) – IoT devices can utilise cloud computing as it offers high speed, performance, flexibility, and sufficient storage space to keep the data safe, find resources, and share information among different users within the same space. (Saleem, 2020)</li>
        <li>Modular Software Development – To be able to utilize the cloud technology, code and applications have to break down into smaller components which are not connected with one another. This makes it simpler for developers to upload their works into the cloud and makes accessing it from remote locations easier too.</li>
        <li>Improved performance – As the use of cloud computing and the amount of ways in which it is used increase, the speed of the networks and how efficiently data is analysed, received and delivered will also increase to meet user expectations and demands. (DataFlair , 2022)</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <h4>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
    <p>Cloud computing is made feasible through virtualization. Management software called a hypervisor is installed on physical servers to link up and virtualize them: abstracting their collective resources and merging them together to generate virtual servers. These virtual resources can then be automated and distributed over the cloud for collective use in a single organization or across numerous organizations. (VMware, 2022 )
    </p>

    <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
    <h4>What is the potential impact of this development?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>Which people will be most affected and how?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4> Will this create, replace, or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
    <h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h4>
    <p>In my daily life it already has an effect as I utilise a lot of technologies that make use of cloud computing such as my email (Outlook), my storage (OneDrive), my entertainment (YouTube Music, Netflix, Disney+), and to get around (Google Maps). I also use SaaS for my schooling, such as Office 365 and will be using virtual machines in the future. There are also many apps or services that may be using the cloud, but I don’t know, such as banking, online shopping, Reddit, and then physical stores that may be using cloud technologies in their back of house or POS.
    </p>
    <h4>What will be different for you?</h4>
    <p>Well as I have kind of grown up with cloud technologies emerging and becoming more common place, I can’t really say what will be different because have already had cloud computing in many aspects of my life for a good chunk of it. Of course, if any major breakthrough such as quantum computing or True AI were to emerge as a result of cloud technologies then that would be a different question, but also one I wouldn’t be able to answer as can’t imagine what it would be like with those technologies being available.
    </p>
    <h4>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
    <p>If the trends of the use of cloud computing in finance and education continue, then my partner and son will be effected in the sense that my partner is studying Accounting online so will be utilizing cloud computing through the delivery of the course and when she starts working as an accountant will be using cloud based systems too. My son is only 4 months at the moment, so by the time he reaches school age I imagine that there will be many more ways then what already exists that cloud computing will be used in his education, such as the delivery of learning materials and the possible use of cloud-based virtual or augmented reality.
