<h2>Common Elements</h2>
<p>
  Although there is a diverse range of ideal jobs within the group, there are a number of core skills required which overlap into all areas.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem-solving ability</li>
<li>Logical and analytical mind</li>
<li>Strong interpersonal and teamwork skills</li>
<li>Commitment to continual learning</li>
<li>Attention to Detail</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although most of the required attributes are not particularly surprising within the field of IT, it is important to note the recurring themes of teamwork and continual personal development to stay up to date in such a fast moving, collaborative industry.

<h2>What Differentiates Each Position</h2>
<p>
  The positions fall into two broad categories; network administration and support roles, and software development and engineering roles.  The security analyst role is a specialised area which could overlap into either category depending on the specific nature of the work.
</p>
<p>
The network administration and tech support roles have a focus on the implementation and day to day operation of IT systems, generally in a business environment.  There is more of a need for troubleshooting problems within the network and implementing solutions which may need to be communicated to users outside the IT profession in these roles.
</p>
<p>
The software developer and engineer roles obviously have more of a focus on programming, and greater fluency in programming languages is required.  Developers work mainly alone or with other IT professionals, and there is great potential for specialisation in areas such as database development or web development.  Software engineering is generally more team – based and focuses on applying software engineering principals to the development, maintenance and evaluation of computer software.
</p>
<p>
The security analyst role requires a more forensic approach, and a deep understanding of the strengths and vulnerabilities of systems.  Fluency in programming languages is important in this role as well, with a specific focus on security.  It is especially important in this area to maintain an in-depth and comprehensive knowledge of the potential risks.

<h2>How Similar Are Your Plans Across The Group?</h2>
<p>
  Three group members (Adrian, Angelo and Aidan) have expressed an interest in network administration or support technician roles, and Luca and Bryan are more interested in software development or software engineering.  Keiran has chosen a more specialised area as a security analyst.  There is, overall, a fairly diverse spread of roles within the group with common themes between some members.
