As a team, K.A.A.L.A.B has utilised two primary tools to complete our project. Microsoft Teams is our main communication and meeting tool as it provides the ability to share files, record and transcribe meetings and easily chat with one another outside of the scheduled meetings. Teams has been invaluable as it’s one simple app that has condensed potentially many avenues of issues if we had attempted to use multiple platforms to achieve the same result. Not without its issues though, Teams has a slight learning curve especially when it comes to making a streamlined workflow. Meetings would sometimes make a channel and sometimes not. It would not always send calendar requests and its transcribe feature can be finicky given the nature of how different microphones and different people can sound online. All in all a very useful tool for group work effort.

Comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.
