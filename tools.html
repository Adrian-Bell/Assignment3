As a team, K.A.A.L.A.B has utilised two primary tools to complete our project. Microsoft Teams is our main communication and meeting tool as it provides the ability to share files, record and transcribe meetings and easily chat with one another outside of the scheduled meetings. Teams has been invaluable as it’s one simple app that has condensed potentially many avenues of issues if we had attempted to use multiple platforms to achieve the same result. Not without its issues though, Teams has a slight learning curve especially when it comes to making a streamlined workflow. Meetings would sometimes make a channel and sometimes not. It would not always send calendar requests and its transcribe feature can be finicky given the nature of how different microphones and different people can sound online. All in all a very useful tool for group work effort.

<br>
Our audit trail on GitHub is a bit of a lopsided mess. Crunch is visible close to the due date of the assignment, a lot of the commits come in around the final week. There are some large commits throughout the entire assignment, however. Each person has uploaded their own content, but the summaries of each commit could be a little more descriptive of the changes taking place. This might be something we look at taking on moving forward to build a routine with GitHub commits when working on group projects. We are hoping to avoid a crunch for Assignment 3 by utilising a single living word document. This will enable all of the members to keep track of each other’s workflow and assist where necessary while maintaining a consistent and professional layout for the master document.
