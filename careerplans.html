<h2>Kieran Goodwill<br>S3939981</h2>

<p>
Through this course, I have maintained an interest in security and the detailed defence against cyberattacks. However, I have also gained a fondness for web programming and have been exploring options in that field of web development, both front end and full-stack. I have been looking at what is required, skills-wise to get into the field, as it can also be linked to security and hit more strengths in my personality traits. Hopefully, overall achieve a more balanced career choice. To achieve this, I plan on completing the Web programming course at RMIT in a semester or two and from there form a more complete decision on a career change. Throughout my degree, I plan on investigating all topics and elements of IT that are related to a career that tickles my curiosity and satiate my enthusiasm in a workplace sense.

<h2>Adrian Bell<br>S3941189</h2>
<img src="assets\images\adrian.jpg">
<p>
As it is still very early in my IT career my career plans very much remain open to change, however at this stage I still intend to move towards Systems / Network Administration or a similar area.  In the short to medium term, I intend to continue with my studies at RMIT, and I hope to complete a Bachelor’s in Information Technology over the next few years.  As my studies progress, I will have the opportunity to specialise in the areas that interest me, and I also intend to transition to a more IT focussed work environment as my experience grows and I can show that I am working towards a tertiary level qualification.

<h2>Angelo Connor<br>S3939995</h2>
<img src="assets\images\angelo.png">
<p>
  The consensus throughout the group as well as myself regarding a career plan, is to stay on course for my preferred job role of Network Engineer. As my studies progress, I’ll be exposed to different areas of IT as well as my preferred specialization of programming/automation. I plan to use my learned knowledge and apply it to my current role to help assist the IT support side to complete daily tasks.

<h2>Luca Pallas<br>S3940012</h2>
<img src="assets\images\luca.png">
<p>
My aim is still to pursue Software Development but I’m also gaining an interest in Web Development too, so I’m sure as more areas are studied, I may find myself drawn towards other topics. Overall, my plan is too just focus on doing well in the course and to use any opportunities that arise to make industry connections so that once I complete my degree (or possibly even before finishing) I can possibly have a job, or at least an internship available.

  <h2>Aidan Fox<br>S3956717</h2>
  <img id=img src="assets\images\aidan.jpg">
  <p>
    While it is hard for me to pinpoint exactly where I want to end up career-wise, I do intend to land myself among the ranks of systems engineers. I’ve always appreciated the hardware side of IT and it feels like something I can comfortably work towards by studying at RMIT. While studying I plan to open the door for myself by passing through the Finance industry as the doors to their IT divisions are left open for people with a passion for IT to work with their systems. I will, however, always keep my eyes open for new opportunities, especially if they’re interesting.

<h2>Bryan Wedding<br>S3956714</h2>
<img src="assets\images\bryan.jpg">
<p>
Through the exposure in this course. I have been exposed to a wider view of the IT industry and have gained a better understanding of all the departments or areas of interest within the industry. For the time being the idea of being a Software Engineer still looks the most appealing to me post study I feel less certain about my direction after completing this course.
</p>
<p>
I feel that through the course I have grown a greater appreciation for the possible directions a career in IT and learned many different areas that I did not realise fell under IT.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, I am hoping to look for a career in IT that I can merge my business and finance skills that I had acquired in the bank with the newly acquired skills that I am looking forward to obtaining during my study at RMIT.
</p>
<p>
I have spoken to some experts at my workplace, and they opened my eyes to the idea of Fintech (Financial Technology) Companies. I feel throughout my studies next semester I will have a closer look at those businesses as a potential career path for me that would match me interests.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
There are a number of similarities and differences between the career plans of the members of Kaalab.  Generally speaking each member still intends to move into the same area they expressed an interest in through assignments 1 and 2, with most members suggesting a shift within the same broad categories.  This observation should be qualified by saying that we are all aware that we will be exposed to many areas within the IT industry in the coming years, and we remain open to pursuing different avenues should we feel it appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The members of Kaalab fall into two broad categories.  Angelo, Adrian and Aidan have expressed an interest in hardware and infrastructure based roles, whilst Kieran, Bryan and Luca are more interested in software development and programming.  This split has remained consistent with our plans during the earlier parts of the course, and the key aspects are compared and contrasted in table 1
