<h2>Kieran Goodwill<br>S3939981</h2>

<p>
G’day! I’m Kieran. I have had a brief foray into IT studies with a Diploma of IT that I completed in 2014. I’ve been interested in the IT field for decades, always dabbling in games or hardware but have now finally started a bachelor’s of IT. Outside of study, I like to play games (both video and board) with friends and rebuild furniture. I have a passion for food and the joy it can spread and host dinners regularly for friends. I am excited to have joined K.A.A.L.A.B to work towards completing our Mythos Project.

<p>
  I currently live in Far North Queensland with my wife and two young boys, having moved here from Northern Ireland in 2007.  I enjoy spending my free time in the outdoors, and have a particular interest in nature photography and mountain biking.  Although I have always had an interest in computers I do not have a professional background in I.T.  I have undertaken this course out of personal interest and to move into the IT profession in the future, possibly as a systems administrator or similar.  I am using my time in K.A.A.L.A.B. to further my skills and expand my knowledge as part of a team of like-minded people.

<h2>Luca Pallas<br>S3940012</h2>

<p>
    My name is Luca Pallas and I’m Australian with my Dad being English and my Mum Italian. Besides this course, I have studied one unit of coding (C++) at university previously and more recently completed a Certificate IV in Programming (C#, Java, SQL, .NET).<br><br>I’m interested in IT, particularly programming/software development as it appeals to the part of me that likes to problem solve, and the fact that programming involves having an issue or desired outcome that needs to be resolved/achieved, and then needing to find the best algorithm/method to do that really interests me. On a broader level this also applies to troubleshooting and testing/bug fixing, as even though it can be frustrating, the sense of accomplishment once you find the solution keeps me interested and wanting to learn more.<br><br> My pastimes are watching shows with my partner, fiddling around with my guitar and bass and playing videogames (Skyrim currently). I’ve also recently become a father to a beautiful baby boy, who is almost 3 months old, so have been enjoying watching him grow and learn new things. I'm enjoying being the 'L' in K.A.A.L.A.B and think we're going to do quite well together.

  <h2>Aidan Fox<br>S3956717</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a Rural boy who grew into computing to keep touch with the world, my Hobbies are exploring new genres of Music, Combat Flight Simulators, Virtual Reality and designing gaming PC’s for friends. I'm passionate about IT and want to learn everything I can so that I can keep what I've learned current. My experience with IT starts and stops at the consumer level however I’ve played at being a support technician long enough for the gap between the mask and me to become hard to see. I'm part of team K.A.A.L.A.B and I hope that I can use some of the skills I taught myself from some of my lesser defining hobbies to really prove myself.

<p>
  Born in Queensland and now residing in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. Worked as a Corporate Banking Professional for 5 years and am now pursuing to develop in IT to hopefully enter a career within the industry.<br><br>

  The change to a career in IT was founded from a childhood interest in computing, Basic HTML and Web-Design. Due to lack of professional skills, I am hoping to further skills as a member of the K.A.A.L.A.B Team and have it potentially lead to a career in Software Engineering & Development.
