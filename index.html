  <div>I'm a Rural boy who grew into computing to keep touch with the world, my Hobbies are exploring new genres of Music, Combat Flight Simulators, Virtual Reality and designing gaming PC’s for friends. I'm passionate about IT and want to learn everything I can so that I can keep what I've learned current. My experience with IT starts and stops at the consumer level however I’ve played at being a support technician long enough for the gap between the mask and me to become hard to see. I'm part of team KAALAB and I hope that I can use some of the skills I taught myself from some of my lesser defining hobbies to really prove myself.

    <!~AF dont know why these are small, but my brain matches in size right now. will either fix later or rely someone else>
    <!also realising now after i've added these that they need to be in a separate part for comparison>
    <!i swear i'm not trying to be stupid, just comes naturally.>
