<h1>Group Processes</h1>

<p>
Over the course of the previous assignment K.A.A.L.A.B. have worked well together to produce a body of work which we are proud of.  As with all collaborative environments there was an initial period of adjustment as all members get to know each other’s strengths, weaknesses and work processes, however we quickly established a consistent routine which saw us deliver an assignment that reflected the effort we put in.
</p>

<p>
Our processes for Assignment 2 centred around twice-weekly meetings conducted on MS Teams.  These were primarily used as a forum to discuss progress which had been made by each member, delegate responsibility for tasks to be completed and were also useful for discussion of ideas.  In addition to this most members were very active on the group chat, and this allowed us to catch up outside of the meetings and ask for advice, assistance or opinions.
</p>
<p>
Each team member worked largely separately on their own content, with the finished documents then being collated into a single file for finalisation and submission.  In hindsight this was probably not the best approach to take, as it was challenging to see what was going on outside of our own area of responsibility and led to a crunch over the last few days where the content had to be pulled together and formatted, whilst ensuring no aspects had been missed.

<p>
Early in the Assignment we became collaborators on the group GitHub repository, and each member was responsible for uploading their own content.  In spite of the challenges mentioned above this worked well, allowing us all to familiarise ourselves with GitHub as well as creating a sense of personal responsibility for our own assigned tasks.  It was also useful to see the content come together in real time on the website to allow for changes in layout etc.
</p>
<p>
Moving forward we have continued to follow many of the same processes that worked well.  We continue to hold twice weekly meetings and use the chat function of MS Teams for discussion and file sharing.  We have continued to work well together on a personal level, with open and honest discussion leading to a constructive collaborative environment.
</p>
<p>
The use of shared word documents was very beneficial when we used it during Assignment 2, so we have decided to expand this to a single master document for the writing of all content in Assignment 3.  This allows all team members to see exactly how the project is progressing in real time, allows us to give and receive feedback on content before it becomes ‘locked-in’ and ensures a level of responsibility, particularly since the workload is so much higher during this period.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion K.A.A.L.A.B. performed well for Assignment 2, quickly establishing a routine of constructive and cooperative work.  We learned a lot about our strengths and weaknesses, as well as establishing good working relationships between all members.  This is still true of our approach during this assignment, however we have tailored some aspects of our workflow to streamline our processes.
