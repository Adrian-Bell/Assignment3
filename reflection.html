Kaalab has performed well as a team, with open communication and constructive collaboration over the course of the project.  The chat function of MS Teams has been beneficial for file sharing and clarification of details, with our twice weekly meetings being useful for talking about progress and ideas for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
If I had to specify one thing that could have been improved it would be the organization of a clear file structure within teams for the sharing of documents.  It can be hard to find things at times, and this is largely due to the team’s lack of familiarity with the program.

I was surprised with the efficiency and usefulness of GitHub as a collaboration tool.  I had assumed that with a fairly limited coding aspect to the project it would be used mainly as a hosting tool, but it has been extremely useful to see the project come together in real time through the use of this tool.
        </p>

I have learned to engage fully with the team and rely on the different skills offered by each member.  Minor issues can be ironed out by other members and a different perspective has been useful for refining of content in many instances.

Kaalab really has grown into the teamwork expected of it, though with some very awkward starts. I believe every member has found where each other’s strengths and weaknesses are and have found how to utilize the former while covering for the latter. The group chat is used for signaling down help for individual tasks while the meetings help hold each member accountable for their respective larger segments of the workload.
    </p>
    <p>
If needed to I could specify that our time management for meetings could be better but I can already see improvements made over the last few weeks towards an ideal for that aspect. An ideal in this area is difficult to achieve with so many different time zones and areas of occupation however and we’ve reached a functional milestone.
      </p>
      <p>
I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly our group went from a collection of students pushed into an unfamiliar role into an organized unit of people working towards a goal, in my experience with teamwork, there’s usually a much greater period of time spent being awkward and uncomfortably formal.
        </p>

I have learned a much more professional use for certain team cohesion skills that I have picked up from certain hobbies of mine, though I'm still fleshing out in my mind what can be used and what is specific to those hobbies, I am following my goals towards professionalizing my skillsets for use in the industry in a way that feels rewarding.          </p>
