        Overall, the group has performed relatively well. There are some communication and workflow wrinkles that need to be ironed out for assignment 3 but hopefully, with a new process, this shouldn’t be an issue moving forwards. A group-wide live document will be implemented for assignment 3 to keep track of how each part connects and to make the final report that much easier by it being completed bit by bit by everyone, building on the overall effort each week.
        <br><br>
        Outside of this, overall communication is good. Our meetings have been beneficial to the success of the assignment progress thus far, however, we will need to implement an action plan after each meeting to comply with the specifications of the project.
        <br><br>
        GitHub has proved to be an infallible tool in being able to work concurrently on major artefacts of a website without conflict. This is a huge boon to have as our workflow for this assignment was to use GitHub as storage for the groups’ efforts and then pull from that to compile the final submission report pdf.
        <br><br>
        I have learnt that groups tend to require a leader to get cohesion and focus for tasks and that I don’t think we achieved that in this assignment. That said I am happy with the final product of our assignment.

    <p>
K.A.A.L.A.B has performed well as a team, with open communication and constructive collaboration over the course of the project.  The chat function of MS Teams has been beneficial for file sharing and clarification of details, with our twice weekly meetings being useful for talking about progress and ideas for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
If I had to specify one thing that could have been improved it would be the organization of a clear file structure within teams for the sharing of documents.  It can be hard to find things at times, and this is largely due to the team’s lack of familiarity with the program.
      </p>
      <p>
I was surprised with the efficiency and usefulness of GitHub as a collaboration tool.  I had assumed that with a fairly limited coding aspect to the project it would be used mainly as a hosting tool, but it has been extremely useful to see the project come together in real time through the use of this tool.
        </p>
        <p>
I have learned to engage fully with the team and rely on the different skills offered by each member.  Minor issues can be ironed out by other members and a different perspective has been useful for refining of content in many instances.

      Reflecting on our current assignment and the way we handled and conducted ourselves throughout the period. I’d say Kaalab did quite well, everyone was able to communicate with each other, provide their own insights, experience, and knowledge in regard to certain topics.
      We were able to make full use of Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other throughout the assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team performed well; we were able to complete what was necessary for our assessment 2. Pleasantly surprised at how we were able to come together as a group, everyone had a say/input in what we did, what we can do and how to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d say one thing to Improve on is our organization, but this is something that is inevitable as we all currently have different occupations and at different stages of our lives. So was hard to be able to organize time for us to all be able to attend and sit down, discuss as a group what needs actioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I’ve learned in groups, is building up my interpersonal skills, especially working within a team, The ability to be able to discuss with other team members or guide them through problems and solutions is very important.

K.A.A.L.A.B really has grown into the teamwork expected of it, though with some very awkward starts. I believe every member has found where each other’s strengths and weaknesses are and have found how to utilize the former while covering for the latter. The group chat is used for signaling down help for individual tasks while the meetings help hold each member accountable for their respective larger segments of the workload.
    </p>
    <p>
If needed to I could specify that our time management for meetings could be better but I can already see improvements made over the last few weeks towards an ideal for that aspect. An ideal in this area is difficult to achieve with so many different time zones and areas of occupation however and we’ve reached a functional milestone.
      </p>
      <p>
I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly our group went from a collection of students pushed into an unfamiliar role into an organized unit of people working towards a goal, in my experience with teamwork, there’s usually a much greater period of time spent being awkward and uncomfortably formal.
        </p>
        <p>
I have learned a much more professional use for certain team cohesion skills that I have picked up from certain hobbies of mine, though I'm still fleshing out in my mind what can be used and what is specific to those hobbies, I am following my goals towards professionalizing my skillsets for use in the industry in a way that feels rewarding.          </p>

      I feel the K.A.A.L.A.B team was exceptionally good at communication and was motivated from the start. After introductions, the team was motivated and adaptive. This allowed the team to quickly form cohesion and begin allocating tasks. From there the regular communication was great for keeping regular updates on where each member of the group was up to and allowed for a great environment with confidence that we had the teamwork to get this assignment completed. </p>
    <p>
    There were times when organisation of our team was not to a functional standard, but this was worked around through effective communication, so this proved the team was very adaptive. If we developed a more organised structure towards getting everything completed that would be more effective when it comes to analysing the team's performance, but it is also just as important for a team to the responsive and quickly adaptive to change so I am immensely proud of my fellow team members for this.
    <p>
      Overall I am happy with the team I completed my tasks with. It had been an awkward time for me due to personal circumstances but thanks to having a sound team I was able to complete my tasks and felt supported and with a well oiled machine of a team.
