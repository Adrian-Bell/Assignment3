        Overall, the group has performed relatively well. There are some communication and workflow wrinkles that need to be ironed out for assignment 3 but hopefully, with a new process, this shouldn’t be an issue moving forwards. A group-wide live document will be implemented for assignment 3 to keep track of how each part connects and to make the final report that much easier by it being completed bit by bit by everyone, building on the overall effort each week.
        <br><br>
        Outside of this, overall communication is good. Our meetings have been beneficial to the success of the assignment progress thus far, however, we will need to implement an action plan after each meeting to comply with the specifications of the project.
        <br><br>
        GitHub has proved to be an infallible tool in being able to work concurrently on major artefacts of a website without conflict. This is a huge boon to have as our workflow for this assignment was to use GitHub as storage for the groups’ efforts and then pull from that to compile the final submission report pdf.
        <br><br>
        I have learnt that groups tend to require a leader to get cohesion and focus for tasks and that I don’t think we achieved that in this assignment. That said I am happy with the final product of our assignment.

    <p>
K.A.A.L.A.B has performed well as a team, with open communication and constructive collaboration over the course of the project.  The chat function of MS Teams has been beneficial for file sharing and clarification of details, with our twice weekly meetings being useful for talking about progress and ideas for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
If I had to specify one thing that could have been improved it would be the organization of a clear file structure within teams for the sharing of documents.  It can be hard to find things at times, and this is largely due to the team’s lack of familiarity with the program.
      </p>
      <p>
I was surprised with the efficiency and usefulness of GitHub as a collaboration tool.  I had assumed that with a fairly limited coding aspect to the project it would be used mainly as a hosting tool, but it has been extremely useful to see the project come together in real time through the use of this tool.
        </p>
        <p>
I have learned to engage fully with the team and rely on the different skills offered by each member.  Minor issues can be ironed out by other members and a different perspective has been useful for refining of content in many instances.

      Reflecting on our current assignment and the way we handled and conducted ourselves throughout the period. I’d say Kaalab did quite well, everyone was able to communicate with each other, provide their own insights, experience, and knowledge in regard to certain topics.
      We were able to make full use of Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other throughout the assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team performed well; we were able to complete what was necessary for our assessment 2. Pleasantly surprised at how we were able to come together as a group, everyone had a say/input in what we did, what we can do and how to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d say one thing to Improve on is our organization, but this is something that is inevitable as we all currently have different occupations and at different stages of our lives. So was hard to be able to organize time for us to all be able to attend and sit down, discuss as a group what needs actioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I’ve learned in groups, is building up my interpersonal skills, especially working within a team, The ability to be able to discuss with other team members or guide them through problems and solutions is very important.

    <p>
      I feel like K.A.A.L.A.B has come together really well as a team and the communication between members has been frequent and collaborative. Each member has their own strengths and weaknesses and I feel we worked together to maximise on those. The use of Teams has made meeting up for group chats, both via video conference and text chat quite easy to manage and the use of GitHub has made collaborating on the different aspects of the assignment very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were areas that I feel could be improved it would be having a more centralised workflow, via a live document, so that we could all see where we're at and what each person has done day-to-day. I also feel moving forward that maybe having a set group leader would also be beneficial just to help structure the group a bit more. I personally feel that I could benefit from that and having set day-to-day, or week-to-week tasks set would help with time management as I feel that has been something I struggled with in this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall though I am quite happy with how our team has pulled together and look forward to working with this group moving forward to assignment 3. They are all great blokes and are funny, professional, interesting, and hard working. I'm glad I got to be a part of this team.

    <p>
K.A.A.L.A.B really has grown into the teamwork expected of it, though with some very awkward starts. I believe every member has found where each other’s strengths and weaknesses are and have found how to utilize the former while covering for the latter. The group chat is used for signaling down help for individual tasks while the meetings help hold each member accountable for their respective larger segments of the workload.
    </p>
    <p>
If needed to I could specify that our time management for meetings could be better but I can already see improvements made over the last few weeks towards an ideal for that aspect. An ideal in this area is difficult to achieve with so many different time zones and areas of occupation however and we’ve reached a functional milestone.
      </p>
      <p>
I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly our group went from a collection of students pushed into an unfamiliar role into an organized unit of people working towards a goal, in my experience with teamwork, there’s usually a much greater period of time spent being awkward and uncomfortably formal.
        </p>
        <p>
I have learned a much more professional use for certain team cohesion skills that I have picked up from certain hobbies of mine, though I'm still fleshing out in my mind what can be used and what is specific to those hobbies, I am following my goals towards professionalizing my skillsets for use in the industry in a way that feels rewarding.          </p>

    <p>
      I feel the K.A.A.L.A.B team was exceptionally good at communication and was motivated from the start. After introductions, the team was motivated and adaptive. This allowed the team to quickly form cohesion and begin allocating tasks. From there the regular communication was great for keeping regular updates on where each member of the group was up to and allowed for a great environment with confidence that we had the teamwork to get this assignment completed. </p>
    <p>
    There were times when organisation of our team was not to a functional standard, but this was worked around through effective communication, so this proved the team was very adaptive. If we developed a more organised structure towards getting everything completed that would be more effective when it comes to analysing the team's performance, but it is also just as important for a team to the responsive and quickly adaptive to change so I am immensely proud of my fellow team members for this.
    <p>
      Overall I am happy with the team I completed my tasks with. It had been an awkward time for me due to personal circumstances but thanks to having a sound team I was able to complete my tasks and felt supported and with a well oiled machine of a team.

<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  As a group, K.A.A.L.A.B. has generated a project that we are all rightly proud of.  As expected there have been some teething problems as we all settled into the routine of not only collaborative work but university work in general.  We have overcome the issues raised by multiple time zones, work schedules, family commitments etc. to form a productive collaborative environment.  Moving forward, we have the potential to continue to work well together to produce more high-quality work as we look to further the Mythos project.
  <br><br>
  Our overall technical skills have improved greatly over the past month, and we have developed a workflow where each person’s strengths and weaknesses are complemented by other members of the team. This will give us a better understanding of which tasks to assign to each person or persons to achieve the desired result.
  <br><br>
  Our records also need to be addressed. We failed to maintain any meeting minutes or actions moving from meeting to meeting so there was no accountability for each member. We constantly had to remind each other of what task we were working on, and this might have dragged the more cooperative tasks to a standstill.
  <br><br>
  Looking over at our individual reflections on how we performed as a group, there are a few common themes that occur, and they are time management, organisation, and structure.
  <br><br>
  Team organisation and structure can be addressed by having a ‘Group Leader’. This will help solidify who is working on which task and what expectations are set for the group as a whole. Everyone will know what is expected of them by the group leader, which leads to fewer misunderstandings about what to do. Moving forward, we would need to implement team goals and objectives, some strict ground rules, task allocation and task maintenance.
  <br><br>
  On reflection, there are definitely areas of concern moving forward when we start our Assessment 3 project, some fine-tuning in one area and major fixings in another. So ideally, we would like to be open and honest regarding these issues, so as to remove future misunderstandings or frustrations with group work. Communication is the utmost key ingredient now (with accountability coming a close second) to determine whether we fail or succeed.  In conclusion, what matters most is what we have learnt from the first phase of group work, what worked well, what didn’t work and how we addressed it so as to learn from our mistakes and grow from strength to strength.
