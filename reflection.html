K.A.A.L.A.B has been an absolute powerhouse. Our team as a whole has managed to utilise each other’s strengths to achieve a functioning prototype of the project I had planned out more than two months ago. I did not expect us to accomplish as much as we have in the time allotted for the assignments and I am impressed with how professional and polished the end product looks. As a team we have all gelled quite well, I have not noticed any abrasive interactions within the group and would happily continue this project onwards in the group if given the opportunity. Our meetings have been jovial and productive and overall have achieved a good balance of updates, information exchanges and tasking of jobs for the project, however, we do tend to go off on tangents and take a bit of time to return to the topic at hand. The aid of minutes has helped this, but it will be something I work on moving forward with my career. I was surprised at how well the group managed to assign themselves jobs in this assignment and work autonomously after the completion of Assignment 2. It felt more impactful to complete this assignment than the last as I feel more connected to the group.

I count myself lucky to have been part of a team which has been able to produce a significant body of work without any real conflict.  We get on well personally, but above that we have maintained a regular schedule of meetings which feature frank, open and honest communication without judgement or ego.  As the project draws to a close, one thing I will take away from the group component is the importance of this honest communication in avoiding conflict.  We recognise each other’s skills and actively do our best to exploit these strengths whilst supporting each other in areas where we have needed advice or assistance.
</p>
<p>
Whilst scheduling of meetings has been regular and they have been very well attended, we could afford to make these meeting more efficient.  Although this has not been a major issue since we are essentially studying in our “free” time it would be prudent to stick to a stricter schedule in a professional setting.
</p>
<p>
We have always been open in sharing our work in draft states, and during this assignment we have all worked together in one master document.  This has made it surprisingly easy to see how the project is progressing and allowed an extremely collaborative approach to report writing which has worked very well.

I’d say the group worked well together compared to A2 (Assignment 2). We approached the project in a more structured way. Created a ‘master word’ document for everyone to choose what they felt comfortable to complete. This allows us a more honest and open approach. We were able to visually see what has and has not been completed as a whole group, allow edits, comments, and recommendations with each other's contributions. Surprisingly this way of working works well for us.
</p>
<p>
Our Biweekly meetings were always eventful and informative regarding what is on our ‘To-Do list’ with Kieran always keeping us on track. Every group member was clear on their responsibilities and group tasks and there were no issues or conflicts within the group that surfaced throughout the group project.
</p>
<p>
We learnt a lot from our feedback from A2 and utilized them to further improve our group work and approached A3 with more of a professional setting. This has worked well in the end as we were able to work collaboratively as a team.

<p>
This assignment felt like it was a lot more organised than Assignment 2 (A2), with much clearer goals and the use of a master document both greatly contributing to this. The fact that we had also settled in as a group also helped as we had passed any awkward phase during A2.</p>
<p>
Improvements wise, all I can really think of is having the meetings be a bit more concise and shorter in length, but that is also due to us all getting along really well and having a laugh, so it’s not entirely a bad thing.
</p>
<p>
I was genuinely surprised at just how much we managed to get put together for Mythos. I mean as it stands, someone could actually use it for its intended purpose quite well. It also looks really good, not just like a plain wiki, which I didn’t expect.
</p>
<p>
Working with these guys has shown me that not only are group projects not always hell but that it is quite feasible to do, with the right tools, with members all over the country. Overall am very happy with how K.A.A.L.A.B worked out and the work we did together.

  <p>
The group we made a few months ago has tacked together closely. I believe every member of the team is holding themselves accountable for the whole project, allowing for the highest quality work. We communicate effectively with the friendliness of close peers. Kieran has taken a bit of a directing lead role and that seems to have brought out a new level of efficiency from each of the team members.
  </p>
  <p>
I'd say with confidence that I'm proud of what KAALAB has achieved in the short time we’ve spent together, we’ve done a lot and gone through everything this project has thrown at us painlessly and effortlessly. I've learned a lot about my natural tendencies in group environments and now have a good strategy to communicate effectively in professional group structures, which is something that will benefit me in my near future.
  </p>
  <p>
I will look back fondly at my time spent with this team, but I will move on confident that they’ve helped me improve my skills while helping propel me into the IT industry. I was able to share my passion and indulge myself in the shared passions of the whole team. I'll be looking forward to seeing what happens next even if we do it separately.

I found that from the last assignment, our group was much more efficient at defining timelines to complete tasks. This resulted in communications in meetings to be more effective and we were able to overall assess the progress of the assignment much more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
I believe that KAALAB can always improve on communication methods and take better advantage of using spreadsheets or RAID records during the project. This would allow better-recorded discourse and help with making the processes more streamlined.
</p>
<p>
I was surprised at the effort of my team. It is not often you get a group of people who are immediately passionate with an innate desire to go above and beyond. I feel very privileged to have the team that I have, and I am extremely impressed with the support levels in our team and feel this team could be successful in any task.
</p>
<p>
I believe what I have learned most about working in groups is that it is important to define roles early and stay in constant communication. It is also important to identify people’s strengths and capitalise on those skills for the betterment of the group. Lastly, I was shown that it is important to communicate shortcomings and make an environment where it is ok for people to be able to be open about shortcomings so that we can handle them as a group.

<h2>Group Relflection</h2>
<p>
After reflecting on how we went with our Assessment 2 work, we understood what our strengths and weaknesses were regarding our work and were able to utilise what works best for us and what we needed to work on. Group communication was one of the vital lessons learned during the first group project. Overall, the group gelled together well, and we had no issues or conflicts. During meetings we kept things light and moving but could sometimes get off track with tangential conversations.
</p>
<p>
We combatted this by creating a to-do list and holding each other more accountable for tasks. This aspect of our collaborative work was an idea by our unofficial lead Kieran to host a live/editable word document. All work would be inputted and reviewed for the whole group’s workload. This way of working worked well with us tremendously since we were able to share our work and progressively see the group’s contribution and assist in any alterations or advice on what to incorporate into the report. We were able to divide and conquer our individual assigned tasks and assign them to those who best fit the task at hand. This allowed us to complete a large amount of our prototyping quickly and thus sped the development process of the project along quite nicely.
</p>
<p>
For the groups’ weaknesses, the relatively smaller scope of the project may have been such as too limiting in the number of artifacts we could produce overall. Therefore, not everyone could be completing multiple unique tasks for the report. This was a choice made early on, deciding to create a functioning prototype instead of a host of comparatively inconsequential artifacts. In hindsight, multiple planned features could have been discussed and prototyped for future implementation to have a more varied workload.
</p>
<p>
  I think all members of K.A.A.L.A.B have grown over the past couple of months and have begun to assess their own strengths and weaknesses when considering group efforts at the beginning of burgeoning IT careers. The overall foray has been a positive one in group work, and we will carry this experience forwards into future group activities.
