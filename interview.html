    <h2>Website Developer</h2>
    <p>
      Erin Fritz is a Front End Web Developer from CVW Creative in Perth. She has a Bachelor of Arts from Curtain University that she completed in 2012. Erin is involved in the entire process and can complete most of the more straightforward website projects if they do not require any specific back end features. Unless following a heavy schedule, Erin will often take clients, both walk-in and by appointment for an initial consult. In this, she will discuss what kind of website they are looking at creating along with any other features required for their business. The most common website they build are called brochure websites. These websites only contain a few pages and contain the necessary information on goods and services the company offers. It’s low maintenance and shouldn’t require too much updating. The project is then passed off for the design phase to their in-house web designer who then creates the layout, colours, graphics, and overall theme to the client’s wishes. Then Erin takes that outline and builds the actual interface. Everything a user interacts with on a website is created by a Front End Web Developer and any information requested by a website is handed off to a Back End Web Developer. Erin works in tandem with Back End Developer on larger projects if there’s a rush on the website but for most cases, she will create the webpage and then hand it off to the Back End Developer to implement those features. She works closely with her mentor and boss, to solve interesting client requests and talk through any issues that may arise in the development process. Another useful debugging skill she implements is called “Teddy Bear”, in which she will talk through her code to a small puppy dog plush (provided by a previous client - RSPCAWA) in order to find and fix any bugs that may be impeding her progress.

      Another aspect of the web development cycle Erin works with is domains and hosting. Her company works closely with both local and international data centres to host their clients’ websites. Erin will contact these external services for any server-based needs. This includes hosting the website itself, fixing any hardware issues that arise, data storage for a website and overall security to the website itself. These websites all require domain names and registration which is taken care of by Erin in her company. Apart from building what the user sees in a website and going through a couple of the more technical things like domains and hosting, a Web Developer also offers training to clients to update the content of their website. This is generally in the form of a hands-on training session, a written document provided by the developer and a potential future training session as clients generally won’t be updating their website as often as they think they might and can need a refresher in updating content. Some larger companies may employ a Website Content Manager to maintain the built website and be the go-between for a developer and the company. Other clients are generally responsible for their content but can often contact outside help in the form of Copywriters that can interact directly with the web developer to complete the project. These options can be offered to the client by the developers if they are finding it hard to get the initial content for the website for launch. This can also be a large hang-up in the development process. Clients are one of the more challenging aspects of creating a website. They can be too picky in what they would like initially or use trending buzzwords in their initial consult. A lot of the time they might not understand what they are asking for and a less experienced developer bring about extra unnecessary work and overly complicated solutions for the client.

      <br>
      The overall website creation process for Erin takes around 20 hours of work for a brochure website. These timings can increase drastically based on the features required by the client. Mailing lists are a common feature bundling in with websites. Mailing lists are excellent marketing tools in the modern age. Being able to reach a mass number of clients directly through email with a new product or a special offer increases the success of marketing campaigns. A lot of companies can leverage existing client lists to push their customers toward a new website. This is especially handy for clients wishing to update or begin an e-commerce marketplace. SEO (search engine optimisation) can also fall under the responsibility of a Front End Web Developer. This helps a website’s overall visibility on search engines and the internet in general. If well configured, A website can expect to be listed higher among the unpaid search engine results. Site speed also plays a large part in a client’s reactions to their new website. Loading times can heavily impact a user’s experience of a website. This can also impede return visits, or worse, lose paying customers to the clients’ competitors. This is especially true for mobile users. Mobile friendly websites are key in 2022 and a high priority for clients when asking for a website, often asking for responsive web pages in their initial consult. A Front End Web Developer is always learning. The industry standard is always changing, and new trends and features are implemented almost as quickly as they are developed. They are constantly learning new tricks and processes to implement in their workflow.

      In her workplace, Erin finds the beginning to end management and development the most rewarding part of her job. She is allowed to work autonomously and as her team is expanding, hoping to acquire a junior developer under her purview which she can in turn mentor. This would be her next ideal progression in her career when we spoke to her. Outside of web development, Erin has gained soft skills to assist with her day to day. She has begun attending networking events and performing public speaking at these gatherings to gain better people skills. Erin and her company regularly enter Australian web awards, this keeps the team engaging in progressive web development and pushing the bounds of web design and development to create reliable, professional websites.
